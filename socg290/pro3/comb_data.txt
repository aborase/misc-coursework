AB Ever since Berger and Luckmann published their treatment of the
   sociology of knowledge in 1966, older versions of the subfield have
   languished, been forgotten, or misrepresented, as if The Social
   Construction of Reality (SCR) eliminated the need to study its
   predecessors in Wissenssoziologie. By considering Berger's subsequent
   statements about the book, along with remarks recently made by Luckmann,
   and then returning to the text itself, this article shows that some of
   the main suppositions on which SCR rests are foreign to the sociology of
   knowledge in its original forms, and that a number of these premises do
   not seem as plausible in today's social world as they may have in the
   early 1960s when their authors formulated them. The unintended scholarly
   results of SCR's surprising publishing success are evaluated.

AB In this paper, I bring Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of
   Reality into conversation with the relatively new subfield of the
   sociology of the senses to argue that greater attentiveness to sensory
   perception can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of the social
   construction of reality. When read with this sensitization, one finds
   implicit references to the senses throughout their discussion, but
   nowhere is sensory perception explicitly theorized as a part of the
   social construction process. Drawing specifically on their analysis of
   primary socialization, face-to-face interaction, language and relevance
   structures, and the fundamental dialectic of externalization,
   objectivation, and internalization, I demonstrate that processes of
   perceptual construction - specifically sensory attention and
   disattention - are key mechanism of social construction underlying many
   of Berger and Luckmann's arguments. A more explicit focus on sensory
   perception not only clarifies and strengthens many of their
   observations, but also constitutes a renewal of their important call to
   examine the processes of social construction.

AB The sociology of knowledge that followed The Social Construction of
   Reality shifted from the study of rarified ideas to practical activity,
   focusing on the stabilization of a sense of shared reality. The opposite
   side of this shift in emphasis has received much less attention -
   activities that place reality into a state of play and, in so doing,
   call attention to its ephemerality. I discuss three empirical areas
   where the practical use of other realities is central to the sociology
   of knowledge. First, I document cases in which skilled practitioners,
   such as airline pilots, safety engineers, and athletes, use simulation
   to prepare for events that are understood as highly uncertain and risky.
   Next, I describe how other realities are mobilized epistemologically,
   such as through experimentation in technoscience and experimentalism in
   unrealized or unbuilt' art and architecture. Finally, I consider
   autotelic and transcendent social experiences through fantasy and
   technological mediations like augmented realities.

AB Unlike recent tendencies to specify the variety of postsocialist
   trajectories, this article attempts to characterize the common features
   of postsocialist capitalism, as it has developed since the 1990s in
   Eastern Europe. Using conceptual tools of economic sociology, the
   postsocialist socio-economic organization is analyzed as embedded
   economy, the institutionalization of capitalism as a moral project, and
   the pervasiveness of informality from the networks and culture
   perspectives. Economic development is viewed as dependent,
   simultaneously, on the system's structural, political and cultural
   features. For postsocialist capitalism, these features include lack of
   state autonomy due to close coupling of political and economic roles;
   the embrace of greed and self-interest as legitimate motives for action;
   and persistence and bolstering of informality as modus operandi.
   Stipulations about developmental consequences are provided in the
   conclusion.

AB This article addresses the question of whether and how internal wars can
   lead to state building. I offer a new conceptual framework for
   understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity,
   as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly
   consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like
   external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they
   enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the
   state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration.
   Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites
   perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests
   with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due
   to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive
   effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this
   framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and
   Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive
   effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.

AB How do people maintain deeply held moral identities in a seemingly
   immoral social environment? Cultural sociologists and social
   psychologists have focused on how individuals cope with contexts that
   make acting on moral motivations difficult by building supportive
   networks and embedding themselves in communities of like-minded people.
   In this article, however, the author argues that actors can achieve a
   moral "sense of one's place" through a habitus that leverages the
   material dimensions of place itself. In particular, he shows how one
   community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral
   identities centered on living "naturally" seem like "second nature,"
   even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by
   reconfiguring their physical world. The author shows how nonhuman
   objects serve as proofs of moral labor, markers of moral boundaries, and
   reminders of moral values, playing both a facilitating and constraining
   role in moral life.

AB This article conceptualizes economies of spectatorship through a case
   study of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (SMR). Economies of spectatorship
   produce spectacular diegeses as commodities sold to spectators and
   sponsors. They develop through a dialectical process of progressive
   decontextualization as their diegeses are cross-marketed with discrepant
   products and services to reach new markets. Progressive
   decontextualization leads to diegetic incoherence that threatens the
   realization of profit. As an economy of spectatorship, the SMR produced
   an outlaw biker themed diegesis replete with vicarious action and
   consumable character gambles. The SMR progressively decontextualized as
   it cross-marketed its outlaw diegesis with establishment corporate,
   religious and political themes. The resulting diegetic incoherence
   threatened profits and required the SMR's producers to make significant
   investments in order to stabilize its flow of spectators and sponsors.
   Conceptualizing such inherently negating processes is critical to
   understanding the commodification of spectacle in mature capitalism.

   revealed patterns of "pivot points" where students' understanding is

AB Blended learning, in the form of screencasts to be viewed online outside
   of class, was incorporated into three sections of an introductory
   sociology course in a liberal arts college setting. The screencasts were
   used to introduce concepts and theories to provide more time for
   discussion in class and more opportunity for students to review concepts
   and theories outside of class. Students' use and their perceptions of
   the impact of the screencasts were assessed with an in-class survey
   instrument in addition to a web-based college-administered survey.
   Although it was not possible to measure the impact of blended learning
   on students' academic performance and learning outcomes in this
   exploratory study, student responses indicated high use of the
   screencasts as well as the perception that the screencasts were helpful,
   contributed positively to performance on exams, and also led to more
   positive feelings about the course more generally. Overall, this
   provides an optimistic initial appraisal of the prospects for blended

   shape sociology's relation to public debate and its abilities to tackle
   the emergent challenges of our time. Sociology was geared since its
   inception toward the collective reflection of not only present or past
   conditions of social existence but also of possibilities for change.
   While deterministic and expertocratic closures limited its potential,
   shifting epistemological, institutional, and social constellations allow
   the expansion, evasion, and re-emergence of open and contestable future
   orientations. Case studies related to climate change, globalization,
   social movements, values, and media are used to explore actual and
   potential contributions to public discourse.

   societies. Specifically, individuals holding post-materialist attitudes
   and living in countries with greater human and economic development
   (measured by higher internet access and tertiary enrollment, and lower
   infant mortality) have lower confidence in future-oriented science. The

AB Sociologists have undertheorized the role of aesthetic judgment in group
   identification. The author argues that the communication of aesthetic
   judgments in face-to-face interaction powerfully works to confirm or
   deny feelings of group belonging. The author introduces the concept of
   community sense, the public face of shared aesthetic judgments that is
   communicated and upheld within a group. The author illustrates this
   concept through an ethnographic case study of an erotic arts club, a
   group predicated on achieving a shared sense of good and bad taste. The
   author shows how the community sense is formed, challenged, and
   sustained in interaction, examining three characteristics of aesthetic
   judgmentsderivation in form, visceral force, and intersubjective
   validitythat together constitute a strong basis for feelings of
   belonging and distinction. This setting acts as a wedge to access larger
   theoretical concerns, as the author explore the relationship between
   aesthetic judgment and feelings of group belonging in diverse contexts.

AB Sociological theorists have long understood the central role of status
   distinctions in producing social inequality. Although empirical studies
   have demonstrated how status hierarchies are reproduced in a broad range
   of cultural domains, there remains little research into where
   legitimating cultural practices take place, where they do not, and the
   role of space itself in producing status differences. As a result,
   sociologists lack a clear understanding of how status hierarchies give
   shape to cities and how the structure of cities might be practiced
   hierarchically. On the basis of interviews at a high-end shopping center
   in Istanbul, Turkey, I examine how consumers enact social rank in
   physical space with specific reference to the social contours of their
   city. Through privileging particular forms of consumption practices
   within socially and spatially exclusive venues, elites map legitimating
   values upon the physical shape of the city itself, providing a
   spatialized understanding of how status inequalities are distributed.

   literatures in environmental sociology and social movements, we examine

   environmental threats in provoking activism in highly repressive
   settings. Using a range of data sources, we illustrate how the
   externalities of extreme production coupled with developing weaknesses
   in the state ultimately incited public protest against the regime. Our
   analysis of protest in North Bohemia provides insight into broader
   patterns of elite legitimacy and resistance. Our findings show that the
   environmental externalities stemming from state-mandated production in
   the North Bohemian region posed an imminent threat that spurred
   residents to protest despite harsh state repression. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for future research on
   environmental and political threats, elite legitimation, and citizen
   activism.

   theoretical questions motivate this study. First, what is the political

   specifically, how can we best understand the association between
   political ideology and public perceptions of science in the current
   polarized environment? Using data from the National Science Foundation's

   culturally and politically divided in its support for the intersection
   of science and the state. Various models of political and cultural
   polarization are tested. Overall, ideological challenges to the cultural
   authority of science cannot be reduced to left-right political
   polarization or to conservative religious beliefs. Instead, skepticism
   on the political right is multifold, involving distinct modes of thought
   and concerns about the institutional ties between science and the state.

AB While there is a wealth of information about the extent to which people
   across the world disapprove of homosexuality, we know a lot less about
   the lenses through which they view same-sex relations. The aim of this
   study is to understand better how homosexuality is framed in the public
   press, and how religion and economic development may combine to shape
   this discourse. Through an analysis of almost 400 newspaper articles,
   this study compares how homosexuality is framed in Uganda, South Africa,
   and the United States. Because these nations have high levels of
   religious belief, but differ in their level of economic development and
   democracy, we can assess how these factors interact to shape portrayals.
   Drawing on work from cultural sociology and the sociology of religion,
   this study shows that the United States is much more likely than Uganda
   to frame homosexuality as a civil rights issue and use entertainers as
   claimsmakers. Conversely, articles from Uganda are more likely than
   those from the United States or South Africa to frame homosexuality as a
   religious issue and draw on religious claimsmakers. Likewise, Uganda is
   much more likely than South Africa to discuss homosexuality in the
   context of Western influences.

   relationship within the stress process framework, we develop a theory
   that traces the influence of income on chronic financial strain which in
   turn affects subjective well-being, which functions as a psychological
   resource for volunteers. Data taken from two waves of the National
   Survey of Midlife in the United States confirm this theory: household
   income has no direct effect on volunteering once chronic financial

AB Sociologists generally agree that history affects or conditions moral
   belief, but the relationship is still only vaguely understood. Using a
   case study of the appearance of social justice beliefs in Victorian-era
   Britain, this article develops an explanation of the link between
   history and morality by applying field theory to capture the historical
   genesis of a field. A moral way of evaluating poverty and inequality
   developed slowly over the course of the nineteenth century in Britain,
   with a trajectory extending back to Malthus's Essay on the Principle of
   Population and moving forward to the Fabians, the Settlement Movement,
   and other social reformers at the end of the nineteenth century. Drawing
   from field theory, I argue that social justice beliefs emerged during
   this time through the genesis of moral universalism as a distinct mode
   of experience. Several recognizable moral beliefs appeared in the
   process, including "equality of opportunity," "equality of reward,"
   "character," and "effort," "ability," and "duty" as forms of merit

   relational entities that are situated and dated by the conditions

   sociology of morality to a critical moral reflexivity instead of moral
   relativism or moral realism.

AB Why do workers participate in their own exploitation? This article moves
   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.

AB This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces
   the payment received for the last client among female sex workers.
   Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate
   a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association,
   and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We
   analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female
   sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish
   between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the
   client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with
   significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are
   associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does
   not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week.
   Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with
   earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over
   the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to
   show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the
   results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging
   the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling
   for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing
   countries.

AB The belief that natural sciences are more scientific than the social
   sciences has been well documented in the perceptions of both lay and
   scientific populations. Influenced by the Kuhnian concept of paradigm
   development and empirical studies on the closure of scientific
   controversies, scholars from divergent traditions associate scientific
   development with increased consensus and stability. However, both the
   macro/quantitative and micro/qualitative approaches are limited in key
   ways. This article is the first comparative ethnography of a natural
   science (molecular biology) and a social science (psychology) and it
   highlights important differences between the fields. Molecular
   biologists engage in a process of bench-building, in which they create
   and integrate new manipulation techniques and technologies into their
   practice, whereas psychologists have far less opportunity for this type
   of development. This suggests an alternative conception of the
   natural/social divide, in which the natural sciences are defined by
   dynamic material evolution while the social sciences remain relatively
   stable.

AB Biomedical and geriatric technologies are having major impacts on the
   development and management of human longevity. Our contention in this
   special issue is that longevity should be considered as a point of
   departure for new forms of politics in which social sciences, in
   particular sociology and politics, can play an important role. In this
   introduction, we argue that emerging consumer markets in biomedicine are
   incrementally redefining the relationship between old age and society.
   Techno-economic transformations are creating new sites of vulnerability
   that are masked by medical utopias of good health and living forever. In
   this context, it is unlikely that such technologies will be able to
   overcome inequalities in distribution and may well exacerbate various
   forms of injustice. By drawing on notions of institutional
   precariousness and scarcity, we conclude that to maintain any degree of
   social solidarity, increasing longevity will force the emergence of a
   sociology of limits.

AB W.E.B. Du Bois' early work as a sociologist from 1896 to 1914 represents
   a milestone in the development of modern sociology. His empirical
   studies often employed a triangular methodological approach, and by
   grounding The Philadelphia Negro in what is the earliest extensive
   social survey by an American sociologist, Du Bois set the stage for the
   growth of sociology as a legitimate science. In fact, his approach
   became the model that the discipline eventually followed. Had Du Bois
   been white, he would have been recognized as a leading founder of the
   field. Since Du Bois' early sociological scholarship was completed
   during the height of the Jim Crow era, his brilliant landmark work was
   largely negated by the profession. His scholarly accomplishments clearly
   focused on establishing a scientific sociology. Based on his exemplary
   work, can sociology finally negate the sociological negation of W.E.B.

AB The WHO's International Studies of Schizophrenia conclude that
   schizophrenia may have a more benign course in developing societies than
   in the West. The authors focus on this finding's most common corollary:
   cultural schemata are shaped by the transition from agrarian to
   industrial society. Developing societies are viewed as traditional,
   gemeinschaft cultures lacking the stigmatizing beliefs about persons
   with mental illness held in modern, gesellschaft cultures of developed
   societies. The Stigma in Global ContextMental Health Study formalized
   the cultural myth of public stigma (CMPS) with propositions linking
   level of development to intolerant, exclusionary, and individualistic
   attitudes. In 17 countries, the authors find no support for the
   corollary; where support is found, the findings are opposite
   expectations, with developed societies reporting lower stigma levels.
   Reconceptualizing of the cultural landscape on more specific dimensions
   also produces null or contrary findings. This correction to nostalgic
   myths of cultural context in developing societies thwarts misguided
   treatment, policy, and stigma-reduction efforts.

AB Community-based participatory research (CBPR) poses ethical challenges
   that are distinct from biomedical research. These arise from the
   epistemological differences between traditional biomedical research
   paradigms and CBPR, as the latter entails ongoing engagement of
   communities in research from development to dissemination. Biomedical
   research typically poses research questions and obtains ethics review
   before engaging with the population or community of interest. While
   institutional review board (IRB) practices seek to minimize harm in
   research conducted with human subjects, traditional IRB review can
   introduce new or exacerbate existing ethical challenges when reviewing
   non-traditional research protocols. In what follows, we seek to: define
   CBPR; identify unique ethical obligations in CBPR; pose potential
   solutions for amending the IRB process to support CBPR; and facilitate a
   research ethics framework that aims to reduce the exploitive and
   appropriational tendencies in research by inviting researchers, IRBs,
   and communities into a collaborative effort aimed at best practices.

AB The practice of community based participatory research (CBPR) has
   evolved over the past 20 years with the recognition that health equity
   is best achieved when academic researchers form collaborative
   partnerships with communities. This article theorizes the possibility
   that core principles of CBPR cannot be realistically applied unless
   unequal power relations are identified and addressed. It provides
   theoretical and empirical perspectives for understanding power,
   privilege, researcher identity and academic research team composition,
   and their effects on partnering processes and health disparity outcomes.
   The team's processes of conducting seven case studies of diverse
   partnerships in a national cross-site CBPR study are analyzed; the
   multi-disciplinary research team's self-reflections on identity and
   positionality are analyzed, privileging its combined racial, ethnic, and
   gendered life experiences, and integrating feminist and post-colonial
   theory into these reflections. Findings from the inquiry are shared, and
   incorporating academic researcher team identity is recommended as a core
   component of equalizing power distribution within CBPR.

   courses, and then we present and analyze a case study based on a
   collaborative community-based research model developed by the
   co-authors. By shifting the theoretical foundations for community-based
   research, and more specifically, grounding our work in feminist ethics
   and critical pedagogy theories, we created linked courses that weave
   both collaborative theory and practice into the fabric of the courses.
   Upon teaching these courses, we found that students responded in an
   overwhelmingly positive way to collaborative theoretical models and to
   collaborative dialogical practice in the classroom, but when it came to
   team-based work conducted with community members, student responses were
   mixed. Reactions to collaborative grading practice conducted by faculty
   members and the community partner were more unanimous: a majority of
   students expressed confusion and discomfort with this practice.
   Collaborative theory and dialogical practice, then, were uniformly
   embraced in the classroom, while team-based work and evaluation in the
   community provided more discomfort and displeasure. This finding
   reiterates the pervasiveness of individualist thinking, even when
   students have chosen courses that are expressly collaborative in both
   theory and practice.

   less likely than Whites to trust the fiduciary ethic, technical

AB Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the
   mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how
   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.

AB It is well known that family socioeconomic background influences
   childhood access to opportunities. Educational reforms that introduce
   new information about school quality may lead to increased inequality if
   families with more resources are better able to respond. However, these
   policies can also level the playing field for choice by equalizing
   disadvantaged families' access to information. This study assesses how a
   novel accountability system affected family enrollment decisions in the
   Chicago Public Schools by introducing new test performance information
   and consequences. We show that a substantial proportion of families
   responded by transferring out when their child's school was assigned
   probation. Poor families transferred children to other schools in the
   district, but at a lower rate than non-poor families, who were also more
   likely to leave for another district or enroll in private school. Most
   striking, we show that despite family response to the probation label,
   access to higher-performing schools changed very little under the new
   policy; students who left probation schools were the most likely of all
   transfer students to enroll in other low-performing schools in the
   district. Although new information changed families' behavior, it did
   not address contextual and resource-dependent factors that constrain the
   educational decisions of poor families.

   violence. I systematically evaluate whether students' levels of global
   empathy, empathetic responses toward victims, definitions of abuse, and
   propensity to agree with victim-blaming attitudes change after
   completing this experiential learning activity. Posttest results suggest
   a statistically significant but small increase in global empathy scores,
   a growth in empathetic responses toward victims, an expansion in
   students' definitions of abuse, and greater disagreement with
   victim-blaming attitudes. I discuss ways sociology instructors can use
   this simulation as a tool to help students comprehend a difficult
   subject matter while simultaneously engendering empathy toward victims

AB The relationship between police violence and race is one fraught with
   both specific historical and contemporary tensions (i.e., white police
   profiling, beating, and murder of people of color) and with ambiguity
   (e.g., what is meant by "race" and how do we operationalize and measure
   "violence" at the hands of law enforcement?). Defining the concept of
   "race" as a multidimensional process of oppression and justification for
   social inequality can shed light on why and how police violence often
   descends upon black and Latino populations as well as why such brutality
   and state surveillance is supported by many whites yesterday and today.
   In this article I analyze the relationships between police violence and
   race as an ongoing feedback loop: "race" produces violence and
   inequality while violence and inequality (re) forms "race." Their
   intertwined formation reproduces the dominant meanings and structural
   location of racial groups in five key domains: ideologies, institutions,
   interests, identities, and interactions - what I call "The Five I's."

   and participation. Over the last 15 years, the idea of multiculturalism
   has come under withering criticism, especially in Europe, in part
   because it is claimed that multiculturalism undermines common
   citizenship. Yet countries with more multicultural policies and a
   stronger discourse of pluralism and recognition are places where
   immigrants are more likely to become citizens, more trusting of
   political institutions, and more attached to the national identity.
   There is also little evidence that multicultural policies fuel majority
   backlash, and some modest evidence that such policies enlarge
   conceptions of inclusive membership. By studying claims-making and the
   equality of immigrant-origin groups, we see that the participatory
   aspect of citizenship needs to take center stage in future work in
   political sociology, social theory, social movements, immigration, and
   race/ethnicity.

AB A central hypothesis about discrimination is that prejudice forces the
   stigmatized into low-paying, undesirable jobs. Prejudice clearly leads
   to exclusion. But surprisingly, evidence linking exclusion to
   disadvantage is mixed. We address this issue theoretically, providing a
   formal rational choice model combining arguments from sociology ( on
   prejudice) and economics ( on competition). Our theory suggests that
   economic organization is crucial. In economies dominated by monopoly,
   oligarchy, tradition, or government, prejudice may reduce some workers'
   pay, and a disadvantageous secondary labor market may emerge. By
   contrast, in competitive free markets, exclusionary discrimination often
   occurs but does not reduce workers' pay, nor does it induce a
   disadvantageous secondary labor market. Our theory suggests the
   conventional analytic approach to discrimination is misguided: Exclusion
   does not necessarily imply disadvantage; a shortfall in pay does not
   necessarily imply that the lower paid worker is disadvantaged; and
   analysis should focus on the overall subjective well-being or utility
   derived from a job, not on pay alone.

   Often overlooked, however, is how the materiality of nature also

   scholars, and economic sociologists more generally, should better engage
   in a historical sociology of concept formation to problematize the human
   exemptionalist paradigm their work upholds and recognize the role of
   nature in shaping markets and society. Unearthing nature in the work of
   Karl Polanyi, I develop a theory of embeddedness that more closely
   accounts for the economic, the social, and the ecological. In doing so,
   I provide a way for scholars to conceptualize both how market societies
   shape nature and how nature shapes market societies.

   and actions within romantic contexts. Using National Longitudinal Study

   experience greater romantic relationship inauthenticity when the
   ordering of events within ideal romantic relationship scripts (e.g.,
   holding hands, saying I love you, having sexual intercourse) diverges
   from ideal romantic relationship scripts of fellow peer-group members.
   Results indicate romantic relationship inauthenticity increases as one's
   ideal script diverges from fellow peer-group members' scripts.
   Importantly, heterogeneity in relationship scripts at the peer-group
   level was not associated with relationship inauthenticity. This study
   highlights the roles cultural reinforcement and social network processes

AB This article explores the subtle yet far-reaching ways that cultural
   environments shape the uses of the evening hours among business
   professionals in three countries. Drawing on interviews with
   professional men and women living and working in Paris, Oslo, and San
   Francisco from a spectrum of professional fields and employers, the
   article explores their evening routines. Three contrasting patterns are
   identified. Where the early evening hours between 17:00 and 21:00 are
   concerned, French, Norwegian, and American professionals traverse
   different cultural terrains. The French professionals and their
   employers treat this temporal zone as a status-conferring period.
   Adhering to a transorganizational cultural convention defining the early
   evening as work time, they use these hours to distinguish themselves as
   committed practioners of their m,tier equipped with status and
   authority. In Norway, comparable professionals approach this period as
   nonwork time off limits to their employer. Early departures from the
   office are encouraged and facilitated in the Norwegian workplace. Among
   the American professionals far less uniformity prevails among the
   evening routines of respondents working in different organizations and
   occupations. This variability is explained by the absence of the
   higher-level temporal conventions present in the two European contexts.
   In the American setting two deciding factors come into play: the
   temporal expectations of the professional's employer and the bargaining
   power wielded by the individual professional vis-A -vis this employer.
   These differences between the evening routines of the three groups
   reflect important cultural differences across countries with broadly
   similar postindustrial landscapes.

   that decision was whether scientific research had achieved consensus
   regarding how children of same-sex couples fare. Determining the extent
   of consensus has become a key aspect of how social science evidence and
   testimony is accepted by the courts. Here, we show how a method of
   analyzing temporal patterns in citation networks can be used to assess
   the state of social scientific literature as a means to inform just such
   a question. Patterns of clustering within these citation networks reveal
   whether and when consensus arises within a scientific field. We find
   that the literature on outcomes for children of same-sex parents is
   marked by scientific consensus that they experience "no differences"
   compared to children from other parental configurations. (C) 2015

AB This essay brings together 'commodity chain' analysis with some of the
   central concerns motivating studies of consumption and consumer culture.
   It argues that we can, from the perspective of capitalist agents and
   agencies, discern important historical shifts in the economic
   significance of the various activities that generate modern consumer
   culture, or 'consumer cultural production'. Shifts in both the nature
   and intensity of competitive pressures imply different roles for
   consumer cultural production within the portfolios and strategies of
   leading capitalist organizations over time. Thus, the essay provides a
   framework for periodizing and linking historical shifts in the
   organization of commodity chains in relation to transformations in the
   structure and nature of consumer cultural production over roughly the
   past century. More concretely, it connects the broad shift from
   commodity chains organized along a 'producer-driven' form to the
   'buyer-driven' arrangement to different kinds of 'market making' through
   consumer cultural production.

AB For decades sociologists have been interested in the labor movement's
   attempts to rebound. Most research, however, focuses on revitalization
   within the service industry, ignoring important efforts in other
   sectors, like construction. As recent scholars argue, revitalization
   within the building trades is unique because organizing workers is not
   the same as organizing work. Locals must simultaneously increase
   membership and market capacity. Unfortunately, existing theories ignore
   many obstacles that building trade unions face in market expansion
   efforts. These obstacles include macro-economic conditions, like the
   Great Recession, which limit work opportunities; inter-union competition
   which allows one Local to expand market share by poaching work from
   another; and cost differentials which continue to prevent unions from
   breaking into new markets. Relying on the case of International
   Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 58, these obstacles are
   explored and used to reformulate current theories on revitalization and
   market recovery within the building trades.

AB Can we identify and theorize contingency as a property of processes and
   situations? Applied to social and historical events, contingency denotes
   a mode of causality characterized by its indeterminate character.
   Conjunctural causation and period effects lack the specificity required
   to identify a distinctive class of processes. References to chance
   happenings offer no clue to analyze endogenous disruptions. Focusing on
   breaks in patterns of social relations and the role played by individual
   agency, the author distinguishes four types of impact-pyramidal,
   pivotal, sequential, and epistemic-and investigates how these relate to
   the possibility of indeterminacy through an Event Structure Analysis of
   the night of August 4, 1789, in Versailles. This empirical foray
   underscores the significance of junctures that are indeterminate with
   respect to their collective outcomes. The article grounds analytically
   this class of conjunctures with the concept of mutual uncertainty,
   gauges the phenomenal scope of this contingency in terms of action
   domains and group types, contrasts it with the notion of chance events,
   and draws its implications for the study of social and historical
   change.

AB This article explores the role of space in social movements, through an
   examination of the case of Tahrir Square in the Egyptian revolution of
   2011. The author argues that the pre-existing, historically specific
   understanding of Tahrir Square as a politicized space of protest drew
   people there in January 2011 and shaped their participation in the
   revolution. Specifically, the author suggests that earlier mobilizations
   that took place in Tahrir Square contributed to the events of the
   revolution in three ways: (1) provided protesters with an idea about
   Tahrir as a target of protests, (2) provided protesters with the idea of
   occupation of Tahrir, and (3) provided protesters with an inspiration in
   the revolution. The article contributes to the literature in sociology
   of space and social movements by proposing that the history of space in
   social movements and previous mobilization matters, but also these may
   shape the new movement and the role of space in protest. This article is
   part of the author's research about the Egyptian revolution of 2011. It
   is based on two phases of historical and ethnographic research in Egypt
   conducted in 2011 and 2012.

AB On 28 January 2011 - as police abandoned the streets and reports of
   theft spread - Egyptians went down to the streets to protect their
   families and property, closing down intersections and setting up
   checkpoints. These neighborhood groups - known as popular committees
   (PCs) - filled the security vacuum and were one of the deciding factors
   of Mubarak's downfall. This article explores how ordinary Egyptians
   collectively acted in order to restore stability during the regime's
   moment of crisis. The author briefly introduces Egyptian PCs by
   discussing other instances of community organizing that occurred under
   extraordinary circumstances. Next, the author focuses on the
   microdynamics of PCs during the 2011 revolution by describing their
   mobilization, social networks, practices, communication methods, and
   dissolution. The PC narrative reminds us that, even during a revolution,
   the actions of ordinary individuals are often ignored by scholars and

   we begin to understand the full complexity of such exceptional moments.

   an assessment of peer review in a quantitative research methods course,
   which is a traditionally difficult and technical course. Data were
   collected from 170 students enrolled in four sections of a quantitative
   research methods course, two in-class peer review sections, and two
   sections that did not incorporate in-class peer review over two
   semesters. For the two sections with peer review, content scheduled for
   the days during which peer review was used in class was delivered
   through the online course management system. We find that in-class peer
   review did not improve final grades or final performance on student
   learning outcomes, nor did it affect performance differences between
   drafts and final assignments that measured student learning objectives.
   Further, it took time away from in-class delivery of course content in
   course sections that used in-class peer review. If peer review is
   utilized, we recommend it be assigned as an out-of-class assignment so
   it does not interfere with in-class teaching.

   creating an enjoyable learning environment in a sociology course.
   Results showed few differences in these outcomes between groups taught
   with the two different methods, although TBL students thought they
   improved their oral communication and creative thinking skills more than
   the lecture students, and they reported getting to know their professor

AB While secrecy enables policy makers to escape public scrutiny, leaks of
   classified information reveal the social construction of reality by the
   state. I develop a theory that explains how leaks shape the discursive
   frames states create to communicate the causes of social problems to the
   public and corresponding solutions to redress them. Synthesizing
   cultural sociology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, I
   argue that leaks enable non-state actors to amplify contradictions
   between the public and secret behavior of the state. States respond by
   ad hoc-ing new frames that normalize their secret transgressions as
   logical extensions of other policy agendas. While these syncretic
   responses resolve contradictions exposed by leaks, they gradually detach
   discursive frames from reality and therefore increase states' need for
   secrecyas well as the probability of future leaksin turn. I illustrate
   this downward spiral of deception and disclosure via a case study of the
   British government's discourse about terrorism between 2000 and 2008.

AB Sociologists have long been interested in collective representations of
   the past, as well as the processes through which individuals, groups, or
   events have been excluded from those representations. Despite this rich
   body of literature, few studies have examined the processes through
   which long-silenced countermemory becomes integrated within official
   public memory. This study examines two instances of silence breaking in
   Philadelphia, Mississippithe town notorious for the silence, denial, and
   collective obstruction of justice surrounding the 1964 Mississippi
   Burning murders. By reconstructing and comparing the event structure of
   the twenty-fifth and fortieth anniversary commemorationsboth interracial
   community-wide events unique for having punctuated Philadelphia's
   prevailing silence on the murdersthis article finds that commemorability

AB Motivated by theoretical and empirical research in life course
   sociology, we examine relationships between trajectories of work and
   family roles across the life course and four measures of economic
   well-being in later adulthood. Using data from the Wisconsin
   Longitudinal Study (WLS) and multiple trajectory-generating methods, we
   first identify latent trajectories of work and family roles between late
   adolescence and age 65. We then model economic well-being at age 65 as a
   function of these trajectories and contemporaneously measured indicators
   of older adults' work, family, and health statuses. Our central finding
   is that trajectories of work and family experiences across the life
   course have direct effects on later-life economic well-being, as well as
   indirect effects that operate through more proximate measures of work,
   family, and other characteristics. We argue that these findings have
   important implications for how social scientists conceptualize and model
   the relationship between later-life economic outcomes and people's work
   and family experiences across the life course.

   examination of collaborations and knowledge flows among researchers. We
   examine the relevant case of Stanford University during a period of
   intense investment in multidisciplinary research, using a novel measure
   of knowledge flows in the short-cycled movement of published references
   from one researcher to another. We describe intellectual cohesion and
   its trajectory among 1,007 faculty members between 1997 and 2006, and
   then examine the social-structural antecedents of dyadic knowledge flows
   that help explain macro-level patterns. Results show that university
   collaborations have grown denser and more integrated across faculty
   members and their institutional divisions. However, this integration is
   led by "star" researchers and is accompanied by a greater centralization
   of knowledge flows around these individuals. Results illustrate
   important shifts in the nature of academic research, and contribute to a
   dynamic view of intellectual cohesion.

AB Durkheim posited that social relationships protect individuals against
   suicide; however, substantial research demonstrates that suicide can
   spread through the very ties Durkheim theorized as protective. With this
   study, we use Waves I, III, and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health to investigate whether young adults' suicide attempts
   and ideations are in part products of exposure to suicidal behaviors via
   their social relationships. We find that young adults who have had
   family members or friends attempt suicide are more likely to report
   suicide ideation or even suicide attempts over both the short and long
   run. This finding is robust to many important controls for risk and
   protective factors for suicide. Our findings have implications for the
   sociology of suicide, not the least of which is that social ties have
   the power to harm in addition to the power to protect.

AB The emergence of market society in Europe prompted a major change in the
   social measurement of individual worth. The formal system of
   aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois
   concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual
   merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution
   commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in
   domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this
   cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and
   comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a
   social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted
   representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited
   ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented
   values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the
   novels point to major differences in the social psychologies
   underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence
   of honor culture well before this occurred historically.

   cultural sociology. The address that he gave before the Second Congress
   of German Sociologists in 1912 was his first formal presentation of the
   discipline. He wrote that the task of cultural sociology was to examine
   the relationship of the unilinear, rational, utilitarian process of
   civilization and organic, vital configurations of culture. The latter
   attempted to establish meaning for the changes generated by the former.

AB Contemporary theory on community suggests that disagreement or conflict
   over foundational beliefs and values greatly decreases the chance that a
   successful, sustainable community experience will develop. My findings
   suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite
   incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and
   values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit
   organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate
   jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental
   mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms
   associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive
   mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of
   objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful
   experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect,
   based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications
   for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social
   psychology are discussed.

AB Organizing collective action to secure support from local communities
   provides a source of power for elites to protect their interests, but
   community structures constrain the ability of elites to use this power.
   Elites' power is not static or self-perpetuating but changing and
   dynamic. There are situations in which elites are forced into
   movement-like struggles to mobilize support from their community. The
   success of elites' mobilization is affected by cultural and structural
   factors that shape the collective meaning of supporting elites' actions
   and the identities that are formed in doing so. I find broad support for
   these propositions in a study of the issuances of small-denomination
   currency substitutes in 145 U.S. cities during the Panic of 1907. I
   discuss the contributions of this article to elite studies, the social

AB This study rehabilitates concepts from classical human ecology and

   advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The
   theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact
   endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns
   recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we
   conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site
   accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was
   assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past
   half centurymost of which remain unacknowledged in government reports.
   Results show how three iterative processeshazardous industrial churning,

AB Weber's typology of religious orientations is incomplete. Much more
   attention has been paid to the other-worldly mysticism of monastic or
   contemplative withdrawal from society than the neglected category of
   inner-worldly mysticism. In Weber's brief treatment, he concludes that
   inner-worldly mysticism results in passive acquiescence to social
   conditions. Alternately, we draw on examples from Mother Teresa and
   Dorothy Day to demonstrate not only how mysticism can be tightly linked
   to the social world, but how mystical practices can create meaningful
   social change. We argue that this change is possible because
   inner-worldly mysticism holds the potential to generate solidarity
   across traditional power and status divides. We illustrate how this
   potential for interaction-level change can spread horizontally; the
   number of small groups committed to carrying out inner-worldly mystical
   practices can grow until such groups spread across communities and
   beyond. In this way, the work of inner-worldly mystics can create
   meaningful change without ever vying for power on the macro political
   stage.

AB Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a broad theoretical framework created by
   synthesizing the main themes of scholars who have challenged dominant
   contemporary understandings of race and the law. Although a theory of
   state tacitly undergirds much critical race scholarship, no one has yet
   aggregated the literature's disparate assertions into a unified theory
   of state. This article represents an initial contribution toward that
   effort. Through comparison with Omi and Winant's (1994) Racial State
   Theory (RST), I identify six central tenets - racialization of the
   state; state as white institutional space; instrumentalism;
   interest-convergence; fluid boundaries; and permanent racist orientation
   - that characterize the CRT of State for the United States. I close by
   entertaining three questions Omi and Winant (2012) argue demonstrate the
   utility of RST and use them to illustrate where the CRT of State I
   outline achieves greater analytical purchase than RST.

AB Noise is widely regarded as a residual categorythe unexplained variance
   in a linear model or the random disturbance of a predictable pattern.
   Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that
   the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where
   noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source
   of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent
   sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the
   theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a
   complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies
   identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and
   predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological
   warning that deterministic assumptions are not an innocent
   simplification.

AB Money has meaning that shapes its uses and social significance,

   welfare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This study, based on
   in-depth interviews with 115 low-wage EITC recipients, reveals the EITC
   is an unusual type of government transfer. Recipients of the EITC say
   they value the debt relief this government benefit brings. However, they
   also perceive it as a just reward for work, which legitimizes a
   temporary increase in consumption. Furthermore, unlike other
   means-tested government transfers, the credit is seen as a springboard
   for upward mobility. Thus, by conferring dignity and spurring dreams,
   the EITC enhances feelings of citizenship and social inclusion.

AB Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative,
   highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making
   established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as
   critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture
   and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency.
   Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather
   than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits,
   revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a
   strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity
   theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for
   the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid
   advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that
   macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights,
   generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But
   event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices
   leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to
   compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in
   turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even
   while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different
   forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different
   institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all
   insurgency by a social group.

   that these differences can be understood in terms of the risks that
   students take in their writing. Journals, which do not incorporate peer
   readership, appear to compel students to take more personal risks and
   engage in emotional labor to process assigned materials. Blogs, which do
   incorporate peer readership, enable students to take more intellectual

   consciousness by framing the study of health in terms of social justice
   issues that were demonstrable across three community partner
   organization sites. Analyses of writing assignments and qualitative
   interviews at the end of the semester reveal that student development of
   critical consciousness was demonstrated through analytic engagement with
   structural and systemic forces framing health inequities as well as
   reflexive consideration of the limited extent to which well-meaning
   efforts and intentions of individuals can significantly impact lasting
   social change. The combination of these two processes simultaneously
   cultivated students' ideological commitments to ongoing social justice
   work and subverted student self-efficacy with regard to the

   to applicants in job interviews affect hiring evaluations. She finds
   that employers use subjective feelings of excitement and enthusiasm
   toward candidates-akin to Collins's concept of emotional energy-to
   evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions. With these data, she
   constructs an original theoretical framework of emotional energy
   development, which highlights the qualities that tend to produce or
   inhibit the subjective experience of emotional energy in job interviews.
   Additionally, she outlines the particular phases of an encounter where
   energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring
   outcomes and inequalities. She discusses the implications of these
   findings for research on hiring, labor market stratification, and
   interaction rituals.

AB In this article, we outline the analytic limitations of action theories
   and interpretive schemes that conceive of beliefs as explicit mental
   representations linked to a desire-opportunity folk psychology. Drawing
   on pragmatism and practice theory, we recast the notion of belief as a
   species of habit, with pre-reflexive anticipation the primary mechanism
   accounting for both the formation of beliefs and their causal influence
   on action. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in three ways:
   first, by linking it with recent research on the cognitive and motor
   development of infants; second, by drawing out a typology of belief
   states that accounts for a range of different experiential traits; and
   third, by applying the new model to reinterpret two belief-based
   phenomena of broad sociological interest: irrational decision making and
   religious conversion.

AB Peer review guides the intensive reworking of research reports, a key
   mechanism in the construction of social scientific knowledge and one
   that gives substantial creative agency to journal editors and reviewers.
   We conceptualize this process in terms of two types of challenges:
   evidentiary challenges that question a study's methodology and
   interpretive challenges that question a study's theoretical framing. A
   survey of authors recently published in Administrative Science Quarterly
   finds that their peer review experience was dominated by interpretive
   challenges: extensive criticisms, suggestions, and subsequent revision
   concerning conceptual and theoretical issues but limited attention to
   methodological and empirical aspects of the work. Salient differences
   between original submissions and published papers include intensive
   reworking of theory and discussion sections as well as growth and
   turnover in citations and hypotheses. We consider implications of the
   dominance of interpretive challenges in successful revision and possible
   sources of variation across scholarly fields.

   symposium on race and transnationalism. It proposes a particular angle
   from which to consider the following seven articles and the study of
   race and racism in general. In response to sociology and neighboring
   disciplines' mounting predictions of Black exceptionalism' and imminent
   assimilation of Asians and Latina/os into whiteness/non-Blackness, a
   two-part alternative approach is briefly suggested: (1) critically
   engage the most theoretically and politically challenging scholarship in
   Black studies (notably outside sociology) that asserts the singularity
   of anti-Black racism; and (2) think through the social positions of
   non-Black peoples of color in light of and not losing sight of the first
   part. An overview of the special issue follows.

AB This paper examines the precolonial and colonial history of race in
   Korea, which has been overlooked in the study of race, empire, and
   Korean history. While the study of race claims to be global, it
   implicitly assumes that racism becomes possible through physical contact
   with different races'. Rather than examining the emergent racial
   politics after the recent global migration, I suggest that racism could
   emerge regardless of collective racial migration and contact. Further,
   recent colonial studies have overlooked the colonized, the Japanese
   Empire and its colonized. Accordingly, I question the absence of race in
   Korean historiography and the assumption of Korean racial naivete based
   on the supposed racial homogeneity. Further, I demonstrate how the
   notions of race and blackness are fundamentally embedded in Koreans'
   understanding of the Age of Empire. Thus, this paper calls for a new
   global' approach to the study of race and empire that questions these
   overlooked assumptions.

AB After the Spanish-American War of 1898, anti-imperialists and
   imperialists hotly debated whether to keep the Philippines as a colony.
   The generation' schema, which communicated racialized views of
   Filipinos/as and their ability to self-govern once they had been
   educated by white Americans, developed in these debates. For both
   imperialists and anti-imperialists, the generation' schema was rooted in
   racialized neo-Lamarckian notions of how the environment (i.e. US
   tutelage and training) could change the character of a non-white group.
   Therefore, this article analyzes debates between anti-imperialists,
   imperialists, and Filipinos/as as they each deployed generations' in the
   field of the colonial state. Using archival sources authored by
   imperialists, anti-imperialists, and Filipinos I find imperialists
   argued that future generations of Filipinas/os held more hope for
   independence in order to dismiss Filipina/o and anti-imperialist demands
   for immediate independence, while anti-imperialists and Filipinos/as
   used the schema to garner policies that incrementally led to
   independence in 1946.

   challenges the claim that the workings of capitalism in the West accord

   Composed as much in the style of history as economics, what explains the
   appeal of this very long, carefully drafted and technically dense text?
   This review is woven of three threads: the method of research behind it;
   its fit with theory and practice in the critical social sciences; and
   what it exemplifies about the ambiguity of leaping from a science
   laboratory into the world of revolutionary praxis. To close, the
   European project of economic management will be briefly discussed,
   suggesting in reference to both French regulation theory and German
   Ordoliberalism why the recent Nobel Prize in Economics, which many
   consider Piketty's work to merit, was lost in favor of another French

AB This article elaborates the social ontology and methodology of carnal
   sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the
   spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-the-making, in the wake of
   debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a
   plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent,
   (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the
   contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the
   social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate,
   suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and
   blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising
   out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what
   modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate
   conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of
   immersive fieldwork based on "performing the phenomenon," is a fruitful
   path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata
   (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under
   investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the
   rewards of "observant participation" and achieve social competency (as
   distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu's
   dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of
   capturing the "spirit of acuteness" that animates such competency but
   vanishes from normal sociological accounts.

   Besides the phenomenology of the researcher's own bodily experience, a
   combination of methods are useful, including emotional expressions and
   rhythms seen through observation, photos, and videos, and informed
   interviewing. Combined methods give a larger picture of all the
   participants on the scene. Viewed more broadly, one of things we find is
   that embodied actors are not equally skilled, but are situationally
   stratified by confrontations among persons with differing degrees of

AB Wacquant's vision of carnal sociology and enactive ethnography draws
   heavily from embodied mind theories in neurocognitive science and
   philosophy of mind. However, it also resonates with feminist
   epistemologies, such as sociologist Dorothy Smith's view that sociology
   should begin with and from the body. While both carnal sociology and the
   neurocognitive traditions it draws from ignore decades of feminist
   contributions to embodied epistemologies, I argue that feminist thought
   has much to contribute to materially grounded accounts of corporeal
   knowledge. Attention to feminist thought should also help enactive
   ethnographers consider the limits to the method, and the ethical and
   political complexities of embodied, situated knowledge.

AB The authority to diagnose is a distinguishing prerogative of modern
   medicine. While a growing body of research addresses various aspects of
   diagnosis, few studies analyze just how it is achieved through
   talk-in-interaction. This paper examines how clinicians assembled a
   diagnosis of a child who was evaluated for autism. Drawing on audio and
   video recordings at a clinic for developmental disabilities, I use a
   combination of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to show how a
   critical fact about the child's mental functioning was formulated,
   challenged, and transformed across three consecutive stages of his
   evaluation: (1) testing, (2) a case conference among clinicians, and (3)
   an informing interview where the diagnosis was delivered to the parents.
   I analyze how this fact emerged as an outcome of clinician-child
   interactions, and how clinicians used storytelling to render its
   diagnostic implications. In addition to examining how these stories are
   methodically produced, I argue that they frame the child's behavior in
   ways that suggest a lack of competence while eliding the skills and
   competencies he may have been displaying.

AB While strong arguments can be made that prosumption today can be seen as
   a primal phenomenon and an evolutionary process, the strongest argument
   is that it involves a revolutionary set of developments producing a
   dramatically new world of prosumption. While those developments can be
   seen in both the material and digital worlds (although they augment one
   another), they are clearest in the digital world, especially the
   Internet. Among the forces that are creating this new world of
   consumption are new means of prosumption (e.g., IKEA, massive online
   open courses, automated teller machines) which are made possible by a
   variety of new technologies (the computer, the Internet). However,
   overarching these and other changes is the emergence of a new form of
   capitalism, prosumer capitalism. In addition to exploiting often
   low-paid commodified workers, prosumer capitalism increasingly
   prioritizes the exploitation of largely uncommodified prosumers who are
   generally unpaid. Prosumers offer the capitalist many other advantages
   (e.g., no long-term obligations such as high-cost benefit programs).
   There are few, if any, obligations to prosumers with the result that
   they fit well with today's reigning neoliberal philosophy. The new world
   of prosumption could have been a more positive development had it not
   been usurped by capitalist interests.

AB This article considers the question of whether, as a number of scholars
   have suggested, we can (or should) develop a theory of institutions from
   the perspective of evolutionary psychology (EP), construed broadly. To
   do so, the article reviews EP's core explanatory strategy and the main
   claims that have been made by proponents of an EP institutional theory,
   focusing on arguments about (1) welfare states and (2) honor cultures
   and the institutions associated with them. On the one hand, the article
   argues, there are both logical and empirical problems with current
   efforts to develop EP theories of these institutional domains. On the
   other hand, sociology's relative absence from the development of such
   theories contributes to these problems, and sociologists can learn from
   EP. Above all, insights drawn from EP may help us to construct better
   accounts of various institutions' micro-foundations. To this end,
   collaboration and exchange between EP scholars and sociologists is
   called for, and some suggestions are made about how this might be done
   most fruitfully.

   systems and their relevance to sociology. I begin by comparing and
   contrasting various definitions of complexity and then describe the
   attributes of systems capable of producing complexity: diversity,
   networked interactions, interdependent behavior, and adaptation. Next, I
   survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance
   with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories:
   dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of
   structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that
   incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the
   introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive
   approach to empirical research, and that the benefits of a deeper
   engagement with complexity will be substantial.

   achievement is concerned (i.e., some positive, some negative, some

AB The existing evidence linking recessions to individual and population
   health presents a puzzle. Some studies show that people who experience
   the kinds of labor market, housing, and asset shocks that proliferate in
   recessions suffer negative health consequences, whereas other studies
   show that mortality rates fall when the economy worsens. This review
   synthesizes evidence from these distinct research traditions in light of
   emerging findings from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. It traces
   pathways by which macroeconomic changes "get under the skin" and
   generate contradictory aggregate-and individual-level consequences.
   Research on the longer-term health effects of recessions could be
   strengthened by integrating theoretical and analytical approaches from
   sociology. These include a multilevel perspective that considers how
   individuals cope with recessions as members of families and communities
   embedded in different policy environments, and attention to cascades of
   recessionary shocks, individuals' strategies for coping with them, and
   the way these intersect with health trajectories.

AB At the close of World War II, "development" began to evolve along two
   paths. On the first path, scholars aimed to generate theoretical
   understandings of social change, especially at the national level
   (development studies). On the second path, policy makers in governments
   and other development-focused organizations initiated actions to promote
   positive social change, especially in poor or war-torn nations
   (development practice). In this article, we review the recent trajectory
   of "development" in sociology, paying close attention to the
   intersections between development studies and development practice.
   Through explicit comparisons to economics and political science, we
   demonstrate how the prominence of development sociology has varied
   historically in relation to its proposed policy prescriptions. We
   conclude by highlighting five uniquely sociological contributions that
   could powerfully improve contemporary interdisciplinary development
   conversations, and by calling for greater sociological attention to the
   complex ways in which a growing transnational field of development
   practitioners is shaping a multiplicity of development outcomes.

AB Improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   education, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups, is widely
   recognized as pivotal to the United States's long-term economic growth
   and security. In this article, we review and discuss current research on
   STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in
   sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that
   different social factors affect the two major components of STEM
   education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b)
   attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional
   on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological
   characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences
   at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels.
   However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES)
   predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological
   factors are more important influences on participation and achievement
   in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family
   SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally,
   American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic
   resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States
   and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require
   more research, a task that is best accomplished through
   interdisciplinary approaches.

AB Sociological research on moral panics, long understood as "struggles for
   cultural power," has focused on the social groups and media conditions
   that enable moral panics to emerge, and on the consequences of moral
   panics for the social control systems of societies. In this article I
   turn instead to modeling the specific cultural process of how the
   conditions for a moral panic are turned into an actual moral panic,
   moving the understanding of moral panic away from its Durkheimian
   origins and towards a process-relational cultural sociology. Drawing on
   Roland Barthes' theory of myth and Kenneth Burke's dramatism, the paper
   posits the cultural process of resignification via synecdoche and
   metanarrative as the driver of the disproportion, concern, hostility,
   consensus, and volatility of moral panics. This process can be carefully
   traced in the case of the Salem Witch Trials; a retrospective reading
   reveals the same process at work in the "Mods and Rockers" panic
   analyzed by Stanley Cohen. Beyond moral panics, theorizing
   resignification as a non-exclusive counterpoint to framing and
   ideational embeddedness enriches the theoretical repertoire of cultural
   sociology. "Deep culture" and mythological signification can, using the
   schema proposed here, be understood as practical
   accomplishments-rhetorical responses to particular situations that, when
   performed successfully, legitimate violence and other forms of
   domination.

AB The racialization of Muslim Americans is examined in this article.
   Qualitative in-depth interviews with 48 Muslim Americans reveal they
   experience more intense forms of questioning and contestation about
   their status as an American once they are identified as a Muslim.
   Because Islam has become synonymous with terrorism, patriarchy,
   misogyny, and anti-American sentiments, when participants were
   identified as Muslims they were treated as if they were a threat to
   American cultural values and national security. Their racialization
   occurred when they experienced de-Americanization, having privileges
   associated with citizenship such as being viewed as a valued member of
   society denied to them. This article highlights the importance of gender
   in the process of racialization. It also demonstrates the need for race
   scholarship to move beyond a black and white paradigm in order to
   include the racialized experiences of second and third generations of
   newer immigrants living in the USA.

AB This article argues that neoliberalism is a critical public issue
   influencing the apparently private troubles of college students and
   teachers. For example, earning a college degree has become ever more
   important for success; yet, because of declining state support for
   public education, students are taking on extraordinary levels of debt.
   As a result, learning is being pushed aside by vocational and other
   considerations that result from neoliberal policy imperatives. For
   teachers, the decline of the tenure system means fewer full-time faculty
   members to do more work and fewer people who have the protection to
   speak out against neoliberal excess. Unless sociology teachers (along
   with teachers in other disciplines) do something to change the current
   system, higher education will continue to decline.

AB In this study we explore how absence from sociology classes is
   understood by undergraduate students at University College Dublin. The
   authors use Scott and Lyman's (1968) concept of accounts to explore
   absence sociologically. Drawing on data generated via focus groups, an
   open-ended questionnaire, and an online survey with students, we outline
   the different excuses and justifications for missing classes used by
   students and present their understanding of attendance at classes as an
   optional feature of student life. Individual students' attendance
   differed across courses, throwing doubt on the usefulness of
   individual-level frameworks for understanding attendance. We argue that
   decisions to attend are influenced by a variety of contextual issues,
   including knowledge of legitimate accounts for the setting, pedagogic
   approaches in use, and students' perceptions of the usefulness of
   classes. We conclude that to counter the trend of declining attendance
   and enhance student learning, it is important to better understand how
   both local norms, values, curriculum design, and assessment practices
   combine to facilitate students' absences. Focusing on accounts allows us
   to better understand student absence rather than accepting this as an
   inevitable feature of contemporary student behavior about which nothing
   much can be done.

AB Instructors at non-research institutions are less able to expose their
   students to research firsthand. Utilizing human subject pools (HSPs) in
   class may be a solution. Given that HSPs tend to be used in introduction
   to psychology classes at research institutions, we examine a community
   college HSP to answer three questions: (1) Do community college students
   positively assess the educational value of HSP experience? (2) Can
   sociology students perceive HSP experience to be as educationally
   effective as psychology students? (3) Can online students perceive HSP
   experience to be as educationally effective as in-person students?
   Results indicate that not only did community college students hold
   positive evaluations of their HSP experience, but sociology and online
   students also felt they benefited as much as psychology or in-person
   students. HSPs were also considered particularly effective by students
   taking research methods. HSP participation may be a viable teaching tool
   for sociology instructors at non-research schools.

AB Sociology of gender has developed beyond a personality-centered idea of
   "sex-roles" to an approach that stresses interaction and social
   structure. At the same time, there has been a concurrent development in
   the psychological sex-differences and medical literatures toward
   including the biological bases of sex-typed behavior and gender
   identities. In this paper, while we conceptualize gender as a social
   structure, we focus only on the individual level of analysis: testing
   the relative strength of (maternal circulating) prenatal hormones,
   childhood socialization, and the power of expectations attached to adult
   social roles (cultural interactionist) as explanations for women's
   self-reported feminine and masculine selves. Our findings are complex,
   and support some importance of each theory. Prenatal hormones, childhood
   socialization, and cultural interactionism were all influential factors
   for gendered selves. While cultural expectations predicted only feminine
   selves, prenatal hormones were more robust predictors of masculine sense
   of self. While personality may be a relatively stable characteristic
   influenced by the body and childhood socialization, our results
   reinforce the importance of studying how the social world responds to
   and reinforces gendered personality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB A recurring theme in the sociology of human rights is the vast

   in principle and their implementation in practice, fueling much debate
   about the effectiveness of international law. Yet, despite this
   disjuncture, a deeper question remains: given all the barriers that have
   impeded the realization of human rights, why have they become so widely
   institutionalized? Revisiting previous work in this journal, I argue
   that one important component of the expansion of human rights is the
   rise of the universal, egalitarian individual as the primary entity of
   social organization in world society. Additionally, I explore how the
   nature of human rights law itself promotes widespread decoupling that,
   in turn, fuels ongoing efforts to close the gap between principle and
   practice. Indeed, while human rights law envisions an ideal world that
   is practically unrealizable, it inspires a never-ending, global crusade
   to bring about that vision.

AB Blood sport-the practice of pitting animals against each other (or

   entertainment that has been resilient since antiquity. While animal
   blood sport is a form of human driven sport related violence that
   involves the abuse and suffering of other animals (Young 2012), it also
   provides an "identity prop" (Dunning 1999): all male competitive sports
   and games provide men with a way to demonstrate masculinity by
   feminizing opponents (Dundes 1997). This theoretical argument has not
   been systematically analyzed in the sociology of sport, and my essay is
   an attempt to fill that gap. I examine animal blood sport with a focus
   on its connection to the validation of masculinity and heterosexuality.

AB Sociologists theorize that people comply with the dictates of states and
   other organizations out of self-interest or because of the perceived
   legitimacy of those in authority. Some organizations, however, are based
   on lies, or secrets, and it would seem that these should be very
   short-lived, given how easy it is for the truth to escape. This article
   lays the foundations of a sociology of deception, focusing on lies and
   secrets successfully maintained for years or even decades. The ideas of
   Goffman and Simmel provide a theoretical starting point. Then Bernard
   Madoff's Ponzi scheme is considered as a case study. Drawing on that and
   other examples, the article culminates in a theory that distinguishes
   between barriers to knowing, barriers to asking, barriers to telling,
   barriers to perceiving, barriers to believing, and barriers to acting.
   Together, these may counter the natural entropic tendency for
   information to leak and diffuse, in part because the effectiveness of
   one sort of barrier may offset imperfections in others.

AB Does the experience of cultural consumption have its own sui generis

   experience, creating an intense internal interaction ritual; (2)
   collective effervescence among the audience; (3) Goffmanian front-stage
   self-presentation in settings of cultural consumption; and (4) verbal
   discourse during and around the cultural experience. Data from highly
   committed opera fanatics in Buenos Aires are used to document the
   extreme pole of cultural consumption that rejects external social
   hierarchies in favor of pure musical experience. This individualized and
   internal style of music consumption resembles religious mysticism, and
   what Weber in his typology of orientations to religious experience
   called virtuoso religiosity, as distinct from typical social class
   orientations to religion and to music.

AB Emile Durkheim's ideas on religion have long served as foundational
   blocks for sociological theories. Yet, a mystery remains over where
   Durkheim's insights into religion came from and especially the event
   that opened his eyes to religion's importance in social life. Durkheim
   never supplied details on this conversion, but he did credit Robertson
   Smith for his new understanding. Did Smith really play the key role in
   Durkheim's turn to religion? This essay examines Durkheim's revelation
   in 1895 by starting from a novel anglethe first edition of The Division
   of Labor and his original stage model with the cult of nature as the
   starting point for religion. Tracing the implications of his initial
   choice of naturism as the elementary religion, a choice he would later
   soundly reject as the product of [a] delirious interpretation, offers
   new insights into why Durkheim found Smith's ideas so inspirational. It
   also sheds light on why Durkheim overhauled his theory of solidarity,
   discarding his famous distinction between mechanical and organic
   solidarity. In Robertson Smith's work, Durkheim discovered a more
   inclusive and enduring basis of solidarity in the social universe.

AB The social model of disability, which defines disability as the product
   of social discrimination rather than the physical, cognitive, or sensory
   differences of individuals, became the dominant logic of the
   international disability field with the 2006 passage of the UN
   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As such,
   grassroots disability associations around the world are advocating for
   new rights. These campaigns promote a new identity frame of disabled
   persons as a universally oppressed group. This identity, however, does
   not benefit all groups equally and actually threatens some. Using
   qualitative methods, I compare the usage of the disability identity by
   two grassroots associations in Nicaragua. Ex-Contra soldiers with
   disabilities use the identity to obfuscate their discredited history as
   "traitors" and, instead, represent themselves as unjustly discriminated
   against disabled persons deserving special benefits and human rights
   protections. Ex-Sandinista soldiers with disabilities also make claims,
   but only reluctantly as disabled, preferring to self-identify as war
   wounded. Because of changes in law, however, Ex-Sandinista soldiers are
   increasingly unable to make claims as war heroes, but must instead
   access benefits as persons with disabilities "in general." This case
   demonstrates how actors strategically use the social model of disability
   in relation to local political culture and group identity.

AB This article examines how collective memory narratives about the
   Holocaust and corresponding performances of classroom emotional labor
   and emotion management are used to teach immigrants in Germany the
   normative civic emotion associated with citizenship. In 2005, following
   legal changes which increased naturalization opportunities, Germany
   created a series of nation-wide orientation classes and integration
   projects aimed at preparing foreign residents for membership. This
   research, based on participant observation in orientation classes and
   interviews with integration workers in Frankfurt am Main, shows that
   civic emotion and associated practices of feeling management play a key
   role in citizen-making projects. Although the emotional content of
   citizenship in most countries is largely positive, consisting of
   feelings like national pride and loyalty, German civic emotion is both
   unique and contested. Most integration workers taught migrants a
   distinctly negative form of civic emotion, which combined sadness and
   shame for the Nazi-era with a rejection of national pride. Some
   attempted to negotiate alternative forms of "safe," specifically
   non-national pride, and a minority of subjects argued that it was time
   for Germans to "stop carrying shame" for the Holocaust altogether and
   re-embrace patriotism. Thus, the emphasis that subjects put on teaching
   the "correct" kinds of civic emotion, along with their disputes over
   what those were, show that even the most intimate and invisible aspect
   of belonging, what individuals feel toward their country, can become
   fertile ground for struggles over citizenship and national identity.

AB A much-theorized but seldom-tested theory is that elites achieve
   cohesion via the social network they form through their affiliations
   with local clubs, religious institutions, civic groups, and other
   voluntary associations. But few scholars have considered how increasing
   diversity with respect to elites' gender, race, and social class may
   undermine such cohesion. We use primary data from interviews with 312
   elites in a large Midwestern city to construct the network of
   affiliations local elites formed with one another. Results from
   bootstrapping analyses suggest that the most influential elites in the
   sample achieved a disproportionately high level of cohesion by virtue of
   the particular voluntary associations with which they affiliated. Not
   only were the most influential elites more connected to one another
   through multiple redundant associational pathways, but their affiliation
   networks were less segregated by gender, race, and social class than
   were the networks formed by less elite members of the sample.
   Instrumental variables regression analyses further show that the most
   influential elites were especially crucial to increasing cohesion and
   reducing segregation in the overall network. We discuss some of the
   mechanisms through which such integration enhances elites' cohesion and
   power.

AB Scholars typically suggest that deliberation, defined as communication
   guided by reason-giving and inclusion, works best behind a veil of
   ignorance or when personal differences are bracketed. In this article we
   explore deliberation within ethnically diverse groups. We operationalize
   ethnicity in three ways: as an aspect of individual identity, as an
   identity that is made salient through priming, and as an enactment
   relative to interactions in particular situations. In this way, we can
   explore the applicability of our previous experimental results to
   ethnically diverse groups. We find similar results: within ethnically
   diverse groups, deliberation matters; participants are more likely to
   reconsider their positions when deliberating than when simply talking
   about politics. Ethnicity has no adverse effects on the quality of
   deliberation, indicating that bracketing has no significant impact. On
   the contrary, when conceptualized as a relational enactment, ethnicity
   is correlated with increased levels of reason-giving and inclusion, and
   hence higher quality deliberation. This suggests deliberation works in
   multiethnic groups in much the same way asif not better thanit does in
   homogeneous groups. Deliberation is a robust form of political
   communication that not only helps manage, but also embraces diverse
   subjective experiences as a part of the political process.

AB Contemporary scholarship understates the resilience of everyday life in

   in a blinkbut in the Buduburam Refugee Camp, a predominately Liberian
   refugee camp in Ghana, people experienced calamitous tragedy accumulated
   over years of daily activities. Though they remained politically and
   economically out of place, residents constructed buildings and other
   ordinary material objects to forge a new lived environment. As residents
   engaged with this new lived environmentfrom building homes to managing
   rainwaterthey regularly participated in moral boundary work that helped
   establish how good people ought to act in inhumane circumstances. Moral
   boundary work did not obviate inequality or conflict, but it did help
   mediate between immediate bodily needs and the wider social order. More
   broadly, the study documents the crucial role that seemingly mundane
   material objects play in moral boundary work. Material objects like
   signs, garbage cans, and homes can operate like sociospatial props in
   the stories that people tell about their daily lives. These stories
   reinforce the moral boundaries that divide good and bad people and
   ultimately help make a shared moral order possible.

AB In this essay, I argue that the very form of the grammatical
   construction a sociology of culture and cognition (which is a
   specification of the more general schema a sociology of [X]) is
   symptomatic of a deeply entrenched form of Primitive Classification
   (which I will refer to as the Comtean schema) that governs the way in
   which sociologists conceive of their place in, and engage with other
   denizens of, the social science landscape. I will also argue that while
   this style of disciplinary engagement might have worked in the past when
   it came to dealing with the standard (nineteenth-century) social science
   disciplines and even some late-twentieth-century upstarts, it will not
   work as a way to engage the now-sprawling postdisciplinary field that I
   will refer to as Cognitive Social Science (CSS). The takeaway point is
   that if sociologists want to be part of CSS (and it is in their interest
   to be part of it because this constitutes the future of the behavioral
   sciences), then they will have to give up the Comtean-schematic thought
   style.

AB This article contributes to sociological studies of identity by shedding
   light on concrete social identification practices and placing these
   practices in cultural context. Gay men's autobiographical accounts,
   gathered in 28 in-depth interviews, show consistent use of a long-held
   feature of American culture: a voluntaristic trope of personal striving
   through social attachments. Citing examples from stories about
   friendship, love, role models, city life, identity politics, and
   religion, the analysis shows how gay men frame their life stories using
   a voluntaristic model of identity. The study also provides evidence of
   change over time in the practices through which gay men construct social
   identities. Younger men report greater ease in finding gay role models,
   especially in professional settings, than do older men. Their accounts
   also support the notion that a therapeutic ethos is becoming ever more
   pervasive in American life.

AB The past 70 years has seen the rise of a new type of actor that falls
   outside traditional conceptions of regulation and value. Fair trade
   organizations regulate production and distribution processes globally
   and provide the infrastructure for a market in which value lies in a
   product's utility and conditions of production and terms of exchange.
   Fair trade emerged to address persistent economic, social, and
   environmental inequalities between global North and South. But what
   explains the rise of the fair trade market over this time period? Using
   time series regression analysis, I evaluate the claims of several
   theoretical traditions and use world society theory to inform economic
   sociology on understanding how social forces shape global markets. I
   find that only after a shift in world cultural norms do processes of
   unequal exchange become problematized so that moves toward
   liberalization in international trade are countered by movements toward
   regulation.

AB A classic question of social science is how knowledge informs practice.
   Research on physicians' decisions about medical knowledge has focused on
   doctors' personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus,
   producing divergent findings. This study asks, instead, How is decision
   making about the use of knowledge influenced by features of work? From
   observations of one team's decisions in multiple clinical and
   administrative contexts, the author argues that making decisions is
   contingent upon temporal features of physicians' tasks. Physicians
   receive feedback at different speeds, and they must account for these
   speeds when judging what they can prioritize. This finding explains
   doctors' perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long
   feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product
   of shorter feedback loops. In these latter scenarios, physicians
   consider and deploy scientific knowledge after-and not before, as is
   usually assumed-determining a fruitful plan of action.

   of two organizations - Food Not Bombs in Orlando, FL and People's

   complicate and oftentimes blunt their transformative potential. In

   government intervention in local markets at the same time that they

   by passing anti-vendor legislation. This story not only offers a case
   study in how teams' monopolistic privilege has extended to concessions
   markets, but also contributes to a broader understanding of how the

AB The recent trend toward health care consumerism is largely the product
   of market practices, which have instilled the notion of health care as a
   product to be purchased by informed, empowered consumers, rather than a
   service bestowed upon a patient by a paternalistic provider. In recent
   years, health care consumerism has been facilitated by
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of pharmaceutical products. In
   this paper, we use the case of DTCA for antidepressant medications to
   examine medicalization techniques used to promote consumerism and
   establish and expand the antidepressant market. We used content analysis
   of DTCA from the 1997-2006 issues of a broad sample of women's, men's,
   and common readership magazines to identify techniques of
   medicalization, and we analyzed in-depth interviews with magazine
   readers and antidepressant users to examine how such messages are
   received. Findings are presented within a framework of economic
   sociology, which allowed us to unveil the links between emotions and
   social action that undergird responses to medicalization techniques and
   consumption of advertised products.

AB The aim of this article is to theorize how materials can play an active,
   constitutive, and causally effective role in the production and
   sustenance of cultural forms and meanings. It does so through an
   empirical exploration of the Museum of Modern Art of New York (MoMA).
   The article describes the museum as an "objectification machine" that
   endeavors to transform and to stabilize artworks as meaningful "objects"
   that can be exhibited, classified, and circulated. The article explains
   how the extent to which the museum succeeds in this process of
   stabilization ultimately depends on the material properties of artworks
   and, more specially, on whether these behave as "docile" or "unruly"
   objects. Drawing on different empirical examples, the article explores
   how docile and unruly objects shape organizational dynamics within the
   museum and, through them, the wider processes of institutional and
   cultural reproduction. The article uses this empirical example to
   highlight the importance of developing a new "material sensibility" that
   restores heuristic dignity to the material within cultural sociology.

AB Social scientists are well-trained to observe and chart social trends,
   but less experienced at presenting scientific findings in formats that
   can inform social change work. In this article, I propose a new
   theoretical concept that provides a mechanism by which social science
   research can be more effectively applied for proactive policy,
   organizational, and program development. The approach is to use the
   metaphor of "desire paths" from landscape architecture to show how
   social scientists can identify and analyze social desire paths that
   appear on the social structural landscape. Social desire paths usually
   emerge because existing formal structures do not meet individual or
   group needs. Such paths are generally started at the individual level,
   followed by others through individual actions, and ultimately leave an
   (usually informal) imprint on the social structure, even though the
   motivations behind those actions are not usually social change. Using
   what we know about the sociology of interests and what we have learned
   from trying to apply social science findings to policy, I propose seven
   criteria for phenomena to be defined as social desire paths. I then
   apply the criteria to two case studies related to housing, and discuss
   social desire paths usefulness to social scientists involved in any
   research that captures interests, deviance, or innovation; and that also
   has the potential to inform formal structures such as policy,
   organizations, program development, and participatory democracy.

AB Although sociologists have long studied public emergency rooms (ERs) and
   their service delivery to the urban poor, little is known about how
   crime control and criminal justice contact affect ER admission
   decisions-a critical oversight given the documented increase in
   incarceration rates, intensification of policing, and proliferation of
   crime control language in public institutions. Using ethnographic
   methods and a count of ER admission decisions (N = 1,114), this article
   describes the continual rushing and delaying of medical resources to
   patients based on their perceived criminality or actual relationship to
   the criminal justice system. These dynamics develop through four
   processes: (1) widespread administration of pain medication, which
   associates waiting patients with criminal narcotics; (2) deployment of
   criminal stigma along race and gender lines to select some qualified
   patients over others; (3) patrolling of waiting rooms by police; and (4)
   rushing of beds to vast numbers of arrestees, inmates, and witnesses.
   Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of
   the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources,
   but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are
   policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.

AB As efforts are made to contain health care spending, the decision to
   stop trying to cure severely ill patients and focus on comfort care has
   become an economic as well as a moral issue. This article examines the
   intricate intersection of economics and morality in U. S. hospice care.
   Using historical, interview, and ethnographic methods, I explain the
   resonance between hospice practitioners' moral motivations and
   policymakers', insurers', and providers' efforts to economize near the
   end of life. Drawing on theoretical literature on morality in markets, I
   analyze the moralization of economic scarcity. I argue that rather than
   posing an external financial constraint on the achievement of moral
   goals, scarcity itself can bear moral meanings. In the case of hospice
   care, the view that "less is better" and the wish to save patients from
   over-treatment converge with financial interests to limit spending on
   end-of-life care and imbue financial constraints with positive moral
   meanings.

   strategies typically used by sociology majors, whether and to what
   extent they engage in metacognitive strategies, and whether teaching
   about learning results in students reporting greater use of
   self-regulatory behaviors. I discuss the importance of self-regulated
   learning and metacognition for student success and describe the ways in
   which I incorporated instruction in these skills into an undergraduate
   theory course. Data collected over the past five semesters illustrate
   the positive effects of these activities on student motivation and use
   of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Students report greater use
   of higher-level cognitive learning strategies such as critical thinking
   and are more intrinsically motivated as a result of taking the course.
   This quantitative investigation of students' use of cognitive and
   metacognitive skills adds to McKinney's (2007) qualitative research on

AB Undergraduate students often have trouble interpreting cultures other
   than that with which they are familiar in a way that takes into account
   the symbols and meanings that explain behaviors, objects, and
   ideologies. Instead, many fall into the trap of making ethnocentric
   assumptions and coming to conclusions that are informed by their own
   cultural perspectives. This in-class active learning exercise makes the
   familiar strange, using Horace Miner's well-known 1956 essay Body Ritual
   among the Nacirema to introduce students to an etic, cultural
   outsider-like description of American culture. Using short excerpts from
   Miner's article, students draw pictures of Miner's descriptions,
   producing a wide variety of interpretations. This activity demonstrates
   that when students overlook or misunderstand cultural meaning, they can
   come to myriad inaccurate depictions and conclusions about social life
   and behavior. It therefore reinforces the importance of developing an
   emic understanding of cultures, rather than accepting social phenomena
   at face value.

AB The authors examine the popularity of boys' given names in Beijing
   before and after the onset of the Cultural Revolution to clarify how
   exogenous and endogenous factors interact to shape fashion. Whereas
   recent work in the sociology of culture emphasizes the importance of
   endogenous processes in explaining fashion, their analysis demonstrates
   two ways in which politics shaped cultural expression during the
   Cultural Revolution: by promoting forms of expression reflecting
   prevailing political ideology and by limiting individuals' willingness
   to act differently. As argued by Lieberson and developed further in this
   article, the second condition is important because endogenous fashion
   cycles require a critical mass of individuals who seek to differentiate
   themselves from common practice. Exogenous factors can influence the
   operation of the endogenous factors. The authors discuss the
   implications of their study for understanding the nature of conformity
   under authoritarian regimes and social conditions supporting individual
   expression.

AB Shiao, Bode, Beyer, and Selvig argue that the theory of race as a social

   they interpret as demonstrating that human biological variation is
   patterned in clinal classes that are homologous to races. In this reply,
   I examine both their claims and the genetics literature they cite,
   concluding that not only does constructivist theory already accommodate
   the contemporary study of human biology, but few geneticists portray
   their work as bearing on race. Equally important, methods for
   statistically identifying DNA-based clusters within the human species
   are shaped by several design features that offer opportunities for the
   incorporation of cultural assumptions about difference. As a result,
   Shiao et al.'s theoretical distinction between social race and

   our best attempts at objectively recording natural human groupings are

AB A basic premise of diffusion theories is that actors vary in their
   susceptibility to social influence and yet little is known about the
   nature and consequences of such heterogeneity in specific market
   domains. The present study examines variation in social influence with
   respect to academic research and citation accumulation. Based on
   theories of uncertainty, signaling, and legitimacy, the main hypothesis
   is that disciplinary outsiders are more likely than insiders to cite
   papers that are already highly cited. The empirical analysis, which
   spans six disciplines and 13 flagship journals, is based on over 800
   articles and the 55,000+ citations they accumulate over a 20-year
   period. Each citation received is classified with respect to both its
   timing and the discipline from which it was sent. The results show that
   the effect of prior citation attention is greater for external citation
   accumulation even after controlling for the fact that externals adopt
   later on average than internals. Contrary to intuition, however,
   outsiders do not appear to uniformly exacerbate citation inequality. The
   broader implications of this study for diffusion and the sociology of
   science are discussed in the conclusion.

AB In aesthetic terms, the category of 'sound' is often split in two:
   'noise', which is chaotic, unfamiliar, and offensive; and 'music', which
   is harmonious, resonant, and divine. These opposing concepts are brought
   together in the phenomenon of Noise Music, but how do practitioners make
   sense of this apparent discordance? Analyses that treat recorded media
   as primary texts declare Noise Music to be a failure, as a genre without
   progress. These paint Noise as a polluted form in an antagonistic
   relationship with traditional music. But while critiques often point to
   indeterminate structure as indicative of the aesthetic project's
   limitations, we claim that indeterminacy itself becomes central to
   meaningful expression when the social context of Noise is considered.
   Through observational and interview data, we consider the contexts,
   audiences, and producers of contemporary American Noise Music.
   Synthesizing the performance theories of Hennion and Alexander, we
   demonstrate how indeterminacy situated in structured interaction allows
   for meaning-making and sustains a musical form based in claims to
   inclusion, access, and creative freedom. We show how interaction, not
   discourse, characterizes the central performance that constructs the
   meaning of Noise.

   involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than
   bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural
   conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its

AB Emile Durkheim summarily rejected Gabriel Tarde's imitation thesis,
   arguing that sociology need only concern itself with social suicide
   rates. Over a century later, a burgeoning body of suicide research has
   challenged Durkheim's claim to a general theory of suicide as 4 decades
   worth of evidence has firmly established that (1) there is a positive
   association between the publicization of celebrity suicides and a spike
   in the aggregate suicide rate, (2) some social environments are
   conducive to epidemic-like outbreaks of suicides, and (3) suicidal ideas
   or behavior spreads to some individuals exposed to a personal role
   model's suicidal behavior-for example, a friend or family member.
   Revisiting Tarde, the article examines why Tarde's theory deserves
   renewed attention, elucidates what he meant by imitation, and then
   formalizes his "laws" into testable theses, while suggesting future
   research questions that would advance the study of suicide, as well as
   other pathologies. Each "law" is elaborated by considering advances in
   contemporary social psychology as well as in light of its ability to
   supplement Durkheim's theory in explaining the "outlier" cases.

   account for their decisions whether or not to run for public office. I
   illuminate how these "deciding to run" narratives reflect racialized

AB Do historically contingent political accounts help explain the growth in

   regressions based on 60 years to detect such relationships by assessing
   interactive associations between the neoliberal departure coincident
   with Ronald Reagan's election and the acceleration in inequality that
   began soon after Reagan took office. We find evidence for this and for a
   second contingent relationship: stronger unions could successfully
   resist policies that enhanced economic inequality only before Reagan's
   presidency and before the neoliberal anti-union administrations from
   both parties that followed Reagan. Politically inspired reductions in
   union membership, and labor's diminished political opportunities during
   and after Reagan's presidency, meant unions no longer could slow the
   growth in U.S. inequality. Coefficients on these two historically
   contingent interactions remain significant after many additional
   determinants are held constant. These findings indicate that political
   determinants should not be neglected when researchers investigate the
   determinants of U.S. inequality.

AB One of the most important components of Antonio Gramsci's social theory
   is his discussion of political strategy, particularly his distinction
   between 'war of maneuver' and 'war of position'. For Gramsci, the
   classical model of revolution through military insurrection (war of
   maneuver) has been supplanted within advanced capitalism by a cultural
   struggle of much longer duration and complexity (war of position).
   Despite the significance of Gramsci's analysis of war of maneuver/war of
   position for contemporary Marxism, it is striking that so little
   attention has been paid to these terms. These terms have a history, both
   in military theory and in Marxism, which predates Gramsci's prison
   notebooks. An examination of the military writings of Engels, Lenin and
   Trotsky, which are grounded more directly on military theory, leads to
   different conclusions about the nature of political strategy and the
   relationship between war of maneuver and war of position.

AB What is the role of measurement in the sociology of culture and how can
   we sort out the complexities that distinguish qualitative from
   quantitative approaches to this domain? In this article, we compare the
   issues and concerns of contemporary scholars who work on matters of
   culture with the writings of a group of scholars who had prepared papers
   for a special symposium on scientific measurement held at the annual
   meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
   (AAAS) back in 1956. We focus on three issues-the recurring need to
   reinvent measurement (as illustrated by the career of the psychologist
   S.S. Stevens), the linkage between qualitative and quantitative methods
   of analysis (as articulated in the writings of the sociologist Paul
   Lazarsfeld), and the assertion (by philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Peter
   Caws) that theorizing necessarily precedes measuring. We review a number
   of important advances in the way that measurement is theorized and
   implemented in the sociology of culture and we also point to a number of
   enduring dilemmas and conundrums that continue to occupy researchers in
   the field today.

AB This article develops a theory of humor and uses it to assess the
   attempt to measure meaning-structures in cultural sociology. To
   understand how humor operates, researchers need to attend to two layers
   of cultural competencies: general typifications and situation-specific
   know-how. These cultural competencies are then invoked in ways that
   define humor as a specific form of experiential frame-the bi-sociation
   of meaning, its condensation, and resonance with experienced tensions in
   the social world. I show the usefulness of this theorization through the
   empirical case of AIDS humor in Malawi, a small country in South-East
   Africa. Using conversational diaries, everyday interactions, and
   newspaper cartoons, I argue both that such humor is widespread and that
   it reveals important facets of life in a country ravaged by the
   pandemic-what it means for the shadow of AIDS to be ever-present.
   Through this case, I then turn back to the question of measurement,
   arguing that although measuring tools may be able to identify
   large-scale semantic shifts, they necessarily miss forms of interaction
   such as humor, that are based on allusion, condensation, and what is
   left unsaid.

AB When it comes to making aesthetic decisions, people commonly account for
   their taste with intuition. A cultural good, symbol, or object is simply
   right and respondents "know it when they see it." This article
   investigates the cultural meanings professional tastemakers see as they
   make such deliberations, while also illustrating the problems
   sociologists have in seeing culture. Using the case of fashion model
   casting and scouting, I present four methods to trace how cultural
   producers recognize and value models' looks in the global fashion
   market, demonstrating how each method results in a different emphasis on
   how culture is used to acquire and deploy aesthetic sense. First,
   interviews capture justifications of aesthetic decisions, as well as
   general processes about day-to-day work routines, which are next tested
   with network analysis, the second method, which emphasizes structural
   arrangements in taste decisions. The third method, ethnography,
   discovers taste as a situated form of knowledge production and
   emphasizes culture in interaction. The fourth and related method,
   observant participation, sees taste as phenomenological as culture
   becomes embodied and tacit consciousness. Each of these methods is an
   optical device that renders a particular and complimentary account of
   taste and affords researchers a certain way to see how culture works.

AB Moral culture can mean many things, but two major elements are a concern
   with moral goods and moral prohibitions. Moral psychologists have
   developed instruments for assessing both of these and such measures can
   be directly imported by sociologists. Work by Schwartz and his
   colleagues on values offers a well-established way of measuring moral
   goods, while researchers using Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory have
   developed validated measures of moral prohibitions. Both values and
   moral foundations are distributed across the social landscape in
   systematic, sociologically interesting ways. Although typically measured
   using questionnaires, we show that values and moral foundations also can
   be used to analyze interview, archival, or "big data." Combining
   psychological and sociological tools and frameworks promises to clarify
   relations among existing sociological treatments of moral culture and to
   connect such treatments to a thriving conversation in moral psychology.

AB Building on a long tradition of measuring cultural logics from a
   relational perspective, we analyze a recent survey of American
   university students to assess whether institutional logics operate in
   the lived experience of individuals. An institutional logic is an
   analytic troika of object, practice, and subject linked together through
   dually ordered systems of articulations. Using the formal method of
   correspondence analysis (MCA) we identify two latent dimensions that
   order physical, verbal, emotional, categorical, and moral practices of
   and investments in love. We take these dimensions as evidence of an
   institutional logic. The dominant first dimension is organized through
   talk of love, non-genital physical intimacies, and affective investment.
   It has no sexual specificity. The subsidiary second dimension is
   organized through moral investment and it has a genital sexual
   specificity. There is little difference between women and men, either in
   the way these dimensions are organized or in the location of men and
   women within these dimensionalized spaces. We find that romantic love
   has a situated material effect in terms of increasing the probabilities
   of orgasm.

AB Recent research and theory at the intersection of cultural sociology and
   network analysis have converged around the notion of cultural holes:
   patterns of cultural choice that position the person as a bridge not
   between other persons but between cultural worlds. This is an approach
   that promises to open up new vistas in our conceptualization of the
   relationship between social position and cultural taste, but that so far
   lacks operational grounding. In this article, I draw on Breiger's (1974)
   formalization of the idea of the duality of persons and groups along
   with classical formalizations of brokerage for sociometric networks
   (Burt 1992) to suggest that the "cultural ego network" of a typical
   survey respondent can be reconstructed from patterns of audience overlap
   among the cultural items that are chosen by each respondent. This leads
   to a formalization of the notion of omnivorousness as relatively low
   levels of clustering in the cultural network: namely, omnivorousness as
   cultural network efficiency. I show how this metric overcomes the
   difficulties that have plagued previous attempts to produce ordinal
   indicators of omnivorousness from simple counts of the number of
   cultural choices, while providing novel substantive (and sometime
   counter-intuitive) insights into the relationship between
   socio-demographic status markers and patterns of cultural choice in the
   contemporary United States.

AB The rise of culture in economic studies has resulted in systematic
   investigations of the shared meanings that shape markets, economic
   decisions, and outcomes. A number of social scientists have a)
   privileged the heterogeneity of meanings within organizations and groups
   over monolithic accounts, b) used thick description and single or
   comparative case studies to investigate the incessant contestations over
   meanings and the corresponding actions facilitated, and c) have
   developed empirically testable propositions without insisting on the
   reduction of meanings to simple principles embedded in structures. This
   line of work does not deny that relatively stable cultural meanings
   exist or that parsimony is possible. Instead, it offers a parallel track
   privileging three modes of analysis: 1) the identification of discursive
   inflection points as leading indicators of market takeoffs, privileging
   thick minimalism over parsimony; 2) breached sequence analyses of
   transactions, highlighting experimental methods; and 3) relational
   analyses of networks and contested circuits, tying situated negotiations
   to overarching cultural structures. The article concludes with a plea to
   keep cultural analyses interpretive, historically grounded, and
   intuitively attuned to the meanings of social life.

AB While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources,
   content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future
   projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with
   the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not
   happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be
   studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives,
   performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I
   call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened,
   future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot
   project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the
   online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
   Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de
   Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public
   interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green
   economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their
   temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network
   mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level
   of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive,
   imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and
   oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of
   future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes
   of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation,
   institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.

AB The rise of the Internet, social media, and digitized historical
   archives has produced a colossal amount of text-based data in recent
   years. While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for
   automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical
   direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural
   sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins
   of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond
   micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that
   adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for
   automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First,
   I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the
   contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of
   automated text-classification methods to classify different types of
   culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I
   explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional
   qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements
   over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and
   cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several
   challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of
   information about the social context in which texts are produced, the
   construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated
   algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural
   sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently
   necessary to work with big data.

   the opportunity and challenge of defining the core knowledge and skills

   of students (N = 280) enrolled in 12 sections of a thematically-focused
   Introductory Sociology course presents our attempt to both define and
   assess a core set of concepts and skills through a pretest-posttest
   questionnaire to measure student learning gains relative to: (1) a
   sociological perspective, (2) sociological theory, (3) research methods,
   and (4) key concepts in sociology. Results show significant learning
   gains on all four dimensions, with the greatest gains coming in
   sociological theory. There were no significant differences in pretest
   scores by gender or by whether students had taken a sociology course in
   high school. Seniors scored significantly higher on both the pretest and
   the posttest, but after we controlled for pretest scores seniors did
   significantly better only on the subset of questions related to
   sociological theory. Students who took a sociology course in high school
   scored lower on the methods subscale of the posttest and had lower
   overall total posttest scores than their counterparts.

AB Theorized as a Bourdieusian field, this article examines changes inside

   as art and some actors taking 'fine art' positions within it. The
   category of tattoo art is distinct from tattoo because it positions the
   practice away from its traditional historic moorings as a lowbrow craft
   and occupation requiring a rudimentary level of technical skill. In
   contrast, tattoo art is created and evaluated within academic discourses
   and traditional fine art ideologies that stress innovation, creativity,
   and exclusivity. In addition to mastery of the medium, that is, applying
   the tattoo to skin, tattoo artists create original works that qualify as
   artistic by art world conventions. This process of artification has
   changed the symbolic meanings and valuation of a practice, imbuing
   tattoo art with cultural legitimacy from the inside.

   varies by network position in both industries, even when controlling for

   conventional thinking on international specialization. Moreover, these
   networks matter only during the period after which the two types of

   logic of the two industries, and are more important for manufacturing
   specialization in the transport-equipment industry. The article

   techniques to test an integrative perspective based on direct and
   indirect effects, taken from human ecology, ecological economics,

   natural sciences. We find evidence for the conjuncture of many of the
   theories investigated and for contextualizing the footprint in a global
   network of causes. The model raises questions about conclusions reached
   in prior analyses based on direct effects only. The significant roles
   played by natural and economic forces suggest a need to attend to

AB In a new theory of conflict escalation, Randall Collins engages critical
   issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible
   theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He
   also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of
   social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative
   concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no
   mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his
   variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a
   computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of
   Collins's theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an
   agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With
   greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my
   alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory
   development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not
   found in Collins's model.

AB Sociologists have yet to theorize interactions with sonic materiality.
   In this article I introduce an analytical concept for the observation of
   interactions with sound. Sound has material effects in all situations.
   But the audibility of sonic objects is a relation of situated actors to
   material arrangements. Sonic object settings are dynamic material
   arrangements in which sonic qualities emerge for interpretation. The
   concept synthesizes research on sonic materiality, audibility, and
   interaction. After outlining the concept, I present an empirical
   illustration from an audio firm's R&D laboratory arranged to support a
   new technology called object-based audio. I observed engineers
   conducting two concurrent but contrasting experiments; results indicate
   how settings both enable and constrain the interpretation of sound.

   the dominant theories of culture in action from cultural sociology are
   limited by their adoption of the individual as the primordial unit of
   analysis. I instead propose a model of culture in action that takes
   social situations as its primordial unit and that understands culture as
   a system of meanings that actors laminate into the situations they face
   through interactive processes of interpretation and performance. I then
   illustrate and develop the model through an analysis of the Great Stink

   against methodological tribalism. Drawing on our own work and on other
   sources, we discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of
   interviewing. We argue that concern over whether attitudes correspond to
   behavior is an overly narrow and misguided question. Instead we offer
   that we should instead consider what interviewing and other data
   gathering techniques are best suited for. In our own work, we suggest,
   we have used somewhat unusual interviewing techniques to reveal how
   institutional systems and the construction of social categories,
   boundaries, and status hierarchies organize social experience. We also
   point to new methodological challenges, particularly concerning the
   incorporation of historical and institutional dimensions into
   interview-based studies. We finally describe fruitful directions for
   future research, which may result in methodological advances while
   bringing together the strengths of various data collection techniques.

AB Can consumers be socially responsible? Can the interests of consumers,
   corporations, and the overall society be reconciled? Traditionally,
   sociologists have conceptualized consumerism as enhancing individual
   wellbeing at the expense of moral citizenship. Yet throughout US
   history, popular discourse has linked consumption to the social good.
   Business schools currently expound this belief in their 'principles of
   marketing' courses. Popular textbooks promote 'relationship management
   marketing' which teaches students to target their most profitable
   customers, develop life-long relationships with them, and promote the
   societal concerns that they care about. The textbooks maintain that
   corporations are well-equipped to address the societal concerns of
   profitable customers through the use of cause marketing, granted minimal
   government interference. We describe this worldview as 'neoliberal
   consumer citizenship' and discuss its implications for social theory and
   a democratic society.

AB This essay examines the role played by Soviet sociology in the USSR's

   the critique of Soviet socio-economic life during the 1980s, identifying
   the emergence of two divergent viewpoints within Soviet sociology over
   the relationship between inequality, the market, and the goals of a
   socialist society. The essay explores how these viewpoints intersected
   with the implementation of economic reforms by the Gorbachev regime,
   arguing that the dominant forces within Soviet sociology ultimately
   helped the party-state bureaucracy craft the legitimizing ideology of
   perestroika by insisting that growing social inequality and market-based
   mechanisms of distribution were the very embodiment of socialism. After
   enduring a politically fraught and semi-pariah existence for much of its
   history, Soviet sociology enjoyed a belle epoque as it helped the ruling
   elite navigate the transition to capitalism.

AB Scholars have recently called attention to the changing nature of the
   American university in the wake of the current economic downturn.
   Considering the transformative nature of knowledge production in the
   United States, we introduce the concept of intellectual closure in
   illustration of the unintended outcomes of individual decisions and
   career trajectories as they operate under the forces of social closure.
   Intellectual closure is defined as subtle and hidden forms of constraint
   on individual agency. Intellectual closure includes calculative thinking
   about how to publish in flagship journals, avoidance of high-risk
   projects, and preference for short-term projects with more immediate
   rewards. Structural constraints, specifically within sociology, are
   enabling the emergence of narrower perspectives and eroding former
   professional norms as individual decisions aggregate, unintentionally,
   to constitute a more competitive discipline with narrower definitions of
   productivity and quality.

AB Anarchism has not had a noticeable impact upon sociology. The two

   to it. This paper contrasts the practitioners or thinkers of one
   tradition against the other. The analysis shows some strong antagonisms,
   many instances of close analysis and critique of each other's
   perspectives, and a number of friendly and supportive relationships
   between anarchists and sociologists. Anarchists tended to admire the
   intellectual rigor of sociologists, but thought sociologists were
   insiders - mere reformers at best, reactionaries at worst - content to
   study society, but rarely to act for its improvement. Sociologists
   viewed anarchists with an even wider range of opinion, including
   considering them principled and admirable revolutionaries, slightly
   naive utopians, or criminals and chaos-lovers bent on the destruction of
   social order. These factors contributed to the exclusion of anarchist
   ideas and anarchists themselves from the sociological canon.

AB A central theme of economic sociology has been to highlight the
   complexity and diversity of real world markets, but many network models
   of economic social structure ignore this feature and rely instead on
   stylized one-dimensional characterizations. Here, the authors return to
   the basic insight of structural diversity in economic sociology. Using
   the Indian interorganizational ownership network as their case, they
   discover a composite-or "hybrid"-model of economic networks that
   combines elements of prior stylized models. The network contains a
   disconnected periphery conforming closely to a "transactional" model; a
   semiperiphery characterized by small, dense clusters with sporadic
   links, as predicted in "small world" models; and finally a nested core
   composed of clusters connected via multiple independent paths. The
   authors then show how a firm's position within the mesolevel structure
   is associated with demographic features such as age and industry and
   differences in the extent to which firms engage in multiplex and
   high-value exchanges.

AB This article examines the methodological implications of the fact that
   what people say is often a poor predictor of what they do. We argue that
   many interview and survey researchers routinely conflate self-reports
   with behavior and assume a consistency between attitudes and action. We
   call this erroneous inference of situated behavior from verbal accounts
   the attitudinal fallacy. Though interviewing and ethnography are often
   lumped together as "qualitative methods," by juxtaposing studies of
   "culture in action" based on verbal accounts with ethnographic
   investigations, we show that the latter routinely attempts to explain
   the "attitude-behavior problem" while the former regularly ignores it.
   Because meaning and action are collectively negotiated and
   context-dependent, we contend that self-reports of attitudes and
   behaviors are of limited value in explaining what people actually do
   because they are overly individualistic and abstracted from lived
   experience.

AB Negotiations about reparations tend to take the language of interests
   and to deal primarily with monetary compensation for disadvantaged
   groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are likely to make a
   variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience,
   ranging from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the
   entire process altogether. This article draws attention to the
   communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims
   that actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they
   hold sacred, but simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of
   self-worth and to elicit identification by raising moral critiques about
   the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005
   removal of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It
   shows that settlers indeed demanded to be compensated fiscally for their
   lost property. At the same time, it shows that they raised objections to
   the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered
   alternate logics of evaluation. The settlers resisted shame and
   devaluation through such competing logics, demanding that the state
   reaffirm a positive and embracing relationship with them despite its
   decision to evict them.

   sociological content into community service classes. The authors
   supplemented a community service course at a large public university
   with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest
   that this integration increased student understanding of the social
   structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served,
   sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and
   discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation
   of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and
   facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of
   populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We

   beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

   within the social construction of gender norms, the sexualization of
   girls and women negatively impacts individual, interpersonal, and
   societal levels of social interaction. Nevertheless, this important
   issue remains under-explored in the sociology of teaching and learning.
   This article reports on a pedagogical module that utilizes a multimedia
   presentation to define and illustrate the sexualization of girls and
   women. Lesson impacts were assessed through an online survey. Results
   indicate a critical gap between the social importance of this topic and
   educational exposure. Students unanimously recommended this module be
   taught in introductory sociology courses and offered specific examples
   of individual and interpersonal impacts. Our findings suggest an ongoing
   need to address the sexualization of girls and women inside, and
   outside, of the classroom.

   toward HIV/AIDS. We report on how stigma affected the service learning
   and other elements of the course, calling for adjustments to our
   pedagogical approach. We also report how the course was evaluated in a
   pretest/posttest assessment on attitudes toward people living with
   HIV/AIDS [PLWHA] (enacted stigma) and hypothetical reactions to being
   diagnosed with HIV (felt stigma). The results indicated greater
   tolerance for PLWHA following the class but also greater awareness of
   HIV stigma and its outcomes. We offer recommendations to help
   instructors avoid stigma-related materials and events that could
   jeopardize service learning and course objectives for sensitive topics
   such as HIV/AIDS.

   introductory-level sociology course syllabi published in TRAILS, the
   Teaching Resources and Innovations Library of the American Sociological
   Association, from two different time periods (2004 and 2010) to explore
   the syllabus as a tool for socialization. We find that syllabi,
   commended for their attention to pedagogical practice, do more than
   communicate course objectives and the means for achieving them. Syllabi
   (re)socialize students for success in the college setting by
   establishing student-teacher roles and norms and setting the tone for
   classroom interactions. The integration of sociological concepts and
   perspectives into syllabi also immerses students into the discipline and
   practice of sociology.

AB Instructors frequently utilize breaching experiments in an attempt to
   bring sociology to life. However, an uncritical embrace of breaching
   experiments obscures the complexity of their possible effects on
   participants and subjects. These experiments have real potential to
   inflict deleterious consequences on individuals and groups.
   Additionally, the presence of videos of breaching experiments on the
   Internet raises questions about activities students are carrying out and
   publicly touting as sociological practice. By giving greater
   consideration to the embeddedness of the breaching experiment and its
   practitioners in the broader social world, students and instructors can
   create breaching experiments that are enlightening while still
   manifesting an appreciation of their effects on the experiments'
   subjects and perhaps even making a contribution to the amelioration or
   transformation of the structures within which they take place.

AB Building on recent research emphasizing how legitimacy depends on
   consensus among audiences about candidates' characteristics and
   activities, we examine the relationship between cultural producers'
   (candidates) position in the social structure and the consecration of
   their creative work by relevant audiences. We argue that the outcome of
   this process of evaluation in any cultural field, whether in art or
   science, is a function of (1) candidates' embeddedness within the field,
   and (2) the type of audience-that is, peers versus critics-evaluating
   candidates' work. Specifically, we hypothesize that peers are more
   likely to favor candidates who are highly embedded in the field, whereas
   critics will not show such favoritism. We find support for these
   hypotheses in the context of the Hollywood motion picture industry.

AB Whichever nomenclature is used to describe the study of black peoples

   the approach that is taken is critically important to academia in terms
   of its potential to provide a direct response and challenge to the
   intrinsic Eurocentric and Orientalist bias of the US educational system.
   Unlike other area and ethnic studies disciplines, this field was
   established as a link between the community and academia. However, in
   recent history, approaches have become polarized and the field has lost
   momentum as a consequence of arbitrary boundaries and politicized
   knowledge. In this article, the Orientalist perspective and Afro-centric
   knowledge in Black Studies are examined in their historical and
   political context. This analysis culminates in a proposed approach to
   use the Sociology of Africa as a new model for Afro-centric knowledge
   and teaching in this field.

AB 'Africana Sociology' begins with a reappraisal of the 'image of Africa'
   in the form of sociology's theoretical narrative about modernity's
   spatial and temporal order. Early sociologists, like Auguste Comte and
   Lester Ward, conceived sociology as a secular discourse, although it
   transmitted Protestant values that reduced people of African descent to
   fetish objects. In the work of Charles H. Long, the 'image of Africa'
   appears in the African American religious imagination because it - more
   than the land in which Blacks were enslaved - authenticated their
   origins. In my appropriation of the concept, it is a semiotic device
   that, through its dialectical relationship with the 'image of
   involuntary presence', structures sociology's narrative form. Like in
   the work of W. E.B. Du Bois, the image of Africa designates the American
   nation as a site of crisis, while imbuing Black subjectivity with a
   wider consciousness of modernity.

AB African American women are continually engaged in challenging
   invisibility, marginalization, and exclusion. Africana Sociology has the
   potential to support these efforts by incorporating key conceptual
   models and constructs from Black Sociology, Afrocentricity, and
   Transdisciplinary Applied Social Justice (TASJ (c)). Africana Sociology
   should recognize the role of intersectionality and socially-constructed
   and intertwined race, class, and gender identities; it should
   acknowledge the importance of African-centered thought, including the
   role of Ma'at; and it should reflect a commitment to praxis -using
   theory to transform social institutions and thus, social outcomes. With
   this conceptual foundation, Africana Sociology can serve as a
   theoretical, methodological, and practical approach for implementing
   transformative change in the experiences of African Americans, and
   African American women, in particular.

AB This essay seeks to contribute to the development of an African-centered
   sociological approach to examine Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer, and intersexed identities and performances. While
   sociologists using the most progressive approaches outline the Western
   hegemonic nature of Africana peoples' perceptions of gender and
   sexuality, neither approach allows sociologists to view the relationship
   between social formations, human consciousness, and cosmological
   patterns. African-centered social scientists and social theorists
   typically determine that Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
   queer, and intersexed identities and performances are outside of
   Africana humanity. Within this essay, the author relies upon the Kemetic
   Anunian cosmology and personality constructs as sources through which to
   develop an African-centered framework to explain the multiple
   expressions of Africana gender and sexuality. This model considers that
   one's gender and sexuality are contained within and inseparable from
   one's higher-self that animates one's existence. This work, then, opens
   the door for further theory development and praxis in the emerging field
   of African-centered sociology and African-centered gender and sexuality
   studies within the discipline of Africana studies.

   conceptual framework in the study of Africana life, history, and
   culture. This conceptual framework has been utilized and expanded on by
   those developing scholarship in the sub-discipline areas of Africana
   Studies, including African-centered psychology, history, and literature.
   However, to date the articulation of an African-centered sociology,
   grounded in an African-centered conceptual framework, has not developed;
   neither has it occurred for African-centered sociology as a
   sub-discipline of Africana Studies, a sub-discipline of traditional
   sociology, or as a stand-alone discipline, itself. After a review of the
   worldview concept and framework and an analysis of the intellectual
   history of Black Sociology, this article then discusses the possibility
   of an African-centered sociology contingent upon the usage of an African
   worldview as the conceptual framework. Finally, the impacts of an
   African-centered epistemology and African-centered social theory are
   considered for the future of African-centered sociology.

   they chose to give birth at home and eschew traditional Western medical
   birthing practices. The women asserted that (1) a desire for control,
   (2) avoiding pharmacological pain relief, and (3) dissatisfaction with
   the medical aspects of intrapartum care were all central in their
   decision-making process. Finally, the participants also alluded to a

AB In the 1860s and 1870s, the feudal monarchy of the Tokugawa shogunate,
   which had ruled Japan for over two centuries, was overthrown, and the
   entire political order it had commanded was dismantled. This immense
   political transformation, comparable in its results to the great social
   revolutions of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in the West,
   was distinctive for lacking a major role for mass political
   mobilization. Since popular political action was decisive elsewhere for
   both providing the force for social revolutions to defeat old regimes
   and for pushing revolutionary leaders to more radical policies, the
   Meiji Restoration's combination of revolutionary outcomes with
   conservative personnel and means is puzzling. This article argues that
   previous accounts fail to explain why a group of relatively low-status
   samurai-administrative functionaries with some hereditary political
   privileges but in fact little secure power within the old regime-was
   able to overcome far more deeply entrenched political actors. To explain
   this, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between two political
   processes: the long-standing political relations of feudal monarchy and
   magnate lords and the unprecedented emergence of independent samurai
   political action and organizations cutting across domain boundaries. It
   was the interaction of these two processes that produced the overthrow
   of the Tokugawa and enabled the revolutionary outcomes that followed it.
   This article's revised explanation of the Meiji Restoration clearly
   places it within the same theoretical parameters as the major
   revolutions of the seventeenth century and later.

AB Extant research in organizational and economic sociology posits that
   organizations derive status from their prior demonstrations of quality,
   as well as their affiliations with high-status alters. Yet there are
   also indications that organizations may acquire status by virtue of
   their membership in salient social categories that are themselves status
   valued. In this article, the author explicitly theorizes and measure the
   concept of categorical status among organizations and test whether it
   influences the evaluation of organizational actions. More concretely,
   she develops a measure of industry status and test whether it affects
   the market reaction to U. S. firms announcing earnings restatements
   between 2000 and 2009. Results of the empirical analyses indicate that
   investors react less negatively to earnings restatements announced by
   firms from higher-status industries, supporting the argument that
   category status acts as a lens that shapes the extent to which an
   organization's actions are viewed favorably.

   to uncover a language of civil purity that people draw on to construct
   their own belonging in civil society. It argues that some people create
   an imagined public-at-large that they infuse with polluting qualities
   associated with the binary cultural codes of civil society. This image
   functions as a mental heuristic, against which people compare themselves
   and see themselves as better than' on a number of moral values
   associated with civil society. This process of constructing civil purity
   is linked to one of the civil sphere's two fundamental social
   institutions, namely communication. As a form of nonfiction media with
   record lows in trust and credibility, the mainstream news serves as a
   social topic through which we can witness the construction of civil

AB This essay reviews works in (political) sociology that offer
   alternatives to sociology-as-usual. Sociologists with even fleeting
   awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely
   familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward
   complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward
   existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience the
   complex contradictions of the social and political world' (Taylor, The
   New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind
   residues or traces,' and contributors in a recently edited volume
   challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces
   and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely,
   popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of
   deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to
   individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised
   by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the
   complexities of contemporary experiments in human being' are just the
   sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center
   of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite
   the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists
   should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential
   multiplicity.

AB Over the last few decades, a steady stream of books decry the decline of
   the public intellectual in modern life, while academics continue to
   express the desire to "make a difference" by producing research that
   contributes to the amelioration of social problems. In this context,
   this article draws on basic and applied research on transgender
   prisoners in California as a case study to address larger questions
   about the pursuit of knowledge, the creation of policy, the prompting of
   praxis, and the promise of justice. The empirical research on
   transgender prisoners in prisons for men presented in this article
   begins with a decidedly specific policy question (how to keep
   transgender prisoners safe from sexual assault in prison) and ends with
   basic research that interrogates the social organization and workings of
   gender (how is gender accomplished among transgender prisoners in
   prisons for men). Reviewing this research and presenting a few
   instructive digressions referred to as "sidebars" leads to two
   conclusions: (1) The line between basic and policy work cannot be
   effectively erased (nor should it be), and (2) basic and applied
   research can be treated as productively interdependent (i.e., take us to
   new research paths and generate new insights). By operating
   side-by-side, basic and policy research can provide us with general and
   particularistic understandings of social processes and structures that
   ultimately help us make a difference in the lives of those who suffer
   the most from systems of inequality, in this case transgender women
   subject to state authority.

AB Huge numbers of children participate in sports. However, kids and sports
   are rarely seen, much less systematically studied by sport sociologists.
   Our survey of the past decade of three major sport sociology journals
   illustrates a dearth of scholarly research on children and sport. While
   noting the few exceptions, we observe that sport studies scholars have
   placed a disproportionate amount of emphasis on studying sport media,
   and elite amateur, college, and professional athletes and sport
   organizations, while largely conceding the terrain of children's sports
   to journalists and to a handful of scholars whose work is not grounded
   in sport sociology. We probe this paradox, speculating why sport
   scholars focus so little on such a large and important object of study
   in sport studies. We end by outlining a handful of important scholarly
   questions for sport scholars, focusing especially on key questions in
   the burgeoning sociological and interdisciplinary fields of children and
   youth, bodies and health, and intersectional analyses of social
   inequality.

AB Scholars largely assume that hog production is following the same
   industrialization process as the integrated poultry industry. Since the
   collapse of hog farming in the 1990s, academics have anticipated that
   producers will eventually become trapped in contracts that leave the
   integrator with full control over the production process. Embedded in
   this prediction is an assumption that hog farmers respond to these
   productive pressures individually. Our analysis of the Carthage
   Management System suggests a different path for the hog commodity chain.
   The Carthage Management System is a conglomeration of business
   management firms that bring finishing hog farmers together to form
   limited liability corporations (LLCs) in the breed-to-wean stage of hog
   production. We use a sociology of agrifood framework to suggest that the
   nuances of hog production encourage the use of what we call folding
   corporations to limit liability in ways that profoundly transform the
   family farm. Corporations and individual hog farmers alike employ this
   creative LLC structure to deflect responsibility for the risks of hog
   production. We identify how folding corporations externalize the costs
   of production onto rural communities. Additional research is needed to
   better understand unfolding farmer identities, legal protections for
   farmers, how widespread organizational structures like Carthage
   Management System are, and their consequences for rural communities and
   the industrialization process.

   narratives wherever farmland, rangeland, and forestland appear
   "underutilized," particularly in the Global South. Though the means and
   motives of these acquisitions are diverse, the lens of "new enclosures"
   lends itself to focusing on their similarities. New enclosures surpass
   the enclosures of bygone centuries in scale and speed and in the
   plethora of resources they reach. Sociological interventions, both
   theoretical and applied, are needed to contextualize and concretize this
   burgeoning alienation of land rights and power contingencies across
   communities and continents.

AB Sociologists of (e)valuation have devoted considerable attention to
   understanding differences in evaluative practices across a number of
   fields. Yet, little is understood about how individuals learn about and
   navigate multivalent valid group styles within a single setting. As a
   social phenomenon, many accept how central processes of evaluation are
   to everyday life. Accordingly, scholars have attempted to link research
   on evaluation to processes of inequality. Nevertheless, the sociology of
   evaluation only has tenuous, often implicit connections to literature on
   inequality and disadvantage. This article addresses these two gaps.
   Drawing on over two-hundred hours of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban
   high school debate league, twenty-seven semi-structured interviews with
   league judges, and archival data, we illustrate how high school policy
   debate judges employ evaluative frames and link them to the
   implementation of evaluative practices in a disadvantaged setting. We
   show that the cultural meanings that emerge within the evaluation
   process-in this case, urban uplift and competition-stem from the
   conflicted context in which evaluation is occurring. We also make a
   first step toward applying the conceptual tools within the sociology of
   evaluation to a disadvantaged setting, and more broadly, suggest that
   micro-processes of evaluation are important to the study of urban
   inequality.

AB This article demonstrates precisely how issues of access-in this case
   differential access to informants and the scenes that they populate in
   three sites-can reveal substantive findings. In the case it features, a
   comparative study of small cities with growing populations of lesbian
   couples, actors' disparate and place-specific sexual identities produced
   disparate and place-specific responses to research. Integrationist
   sexual identities impeded access, whereas identity-politics orientations
   facilitated it. The paper identifies three mechanisms via which sexual
   identities influenced access: directly, by shaping informants'
   orientations to the research topic, and, indirectly, by influencing
   local networks and institutions that emerge from and reinforce local
   identities. By explicating one ethnographer's path from methodological
   trouble to substantive insight, the article traces the utility of an
   expansive and flexible reflexivity that begins with but extends beyond
   the researcher's identity and role. This reflexivity, the article
   proposes, encourages identification of substantive findings and the
   development of social theory, and can advance a comparative sociology of
   ethnographic access.

AB Using the 2009 Korean General Social Survey (N = 1,422), we examine (1)
   if religious variables affect suicide acceptability-attitudes and norms
   regarding the acceptability of suicide; and (2) whether religious
   variables dampen the otherwise strong effects of stress on suicide
   acceptability. We find that Protestantism, religious attendance, and
   religious salience are associated with lower levels of suicide
   acceptability. Yet, the negative impact of Protestantism is entirely
   mediated by religious attendance and salience. Moreover, the effects of
   stress on suicide acceptability are attenuated for those who have higher
   levels of religious attendance and salience. These results have
   important implications for understanding suicide acceptability and
   suicide, especially the Protestant-Catholic differences first recognized
   by Emile Durkheim.

AB The social stratification that takes place during the transition out of
   high school is traditionally explained with theoretical frameworks such
   as status attainment and social reproduction. In our paper, we suggest
   the cumulative dis/advantage hypothesis as an alternative theoretical
   and empirical approach that explains this divergence in institutional
   pathways as the result of the dynamic interplay between social
   institutions (in our case, schools) and individuals' resources.
   We use data from the NLSY79 in order to compute institutional pathways
   (defined by educational and occupational status) of 9200 high school
   graduates. Optimal Matching Analysis and Cluster Analysis generated a
   typology of life course pathways. Our results show that both ascribed
   characteristics and students' high school characteristics and resources
   are predictors of post-high school pathways. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

AB School boards have received little attention in sociology of education.
   Drawing on organizational sociology, a model of school board social
   capital is proposed that treats brokerage (external ties) and closure
   (internal ties) as the key dimensions of board functioning. The model
   brings together insights from limited research on school boards
   concerning members' internal and external ties and recasts them as the
   building blocks of a unifying theoretical framework. It also proposes
   specific performance outcomes at the district level. The model is tested
   using the data from a representative sample of Pennsylvania districts.
   The analysis not only explores brokerage and closure patterns among
   school boards, but also examines their implications for academic
   outcomes. Findings suggest that eighth grade reading and mathematics
   performance are highest in districts, where boards exhibit high levels
   of both brokerage and closure, and lowest in districts, where brokerage
   and closure are both low.

AB Endogenous selection bias is a central problem for causal inference.
   Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in practice. This
   article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous
   selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernan et al.
   2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to
   highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g.,
   controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider
   variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
   one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is
   (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can
   result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome
   variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable.
   We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias,
   common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous
   examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network
   analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of
   education.

AB Sociologists are adding specific disciplinary accents to the burgeoning
   literature in colonial, imperial, and postcolonial studies. They have
   been especially keen to add explanatory accounts to the historical
   literature on empires. Starting in the 1950s, sociologists pioneered the
   study of colonies as historical formations. Against traditional
   anthropological approaches, sociologists insisted on studying colonizer
   and colonized in their dynamic interactions, asking how both groups were
   being transformed. Like contemporary postcolonial scholars, sociologists
   began asking in the 1950s how metropoles were being remade by overseas
   colonialism and colonial immigration. Echoing discussions in the 1950s
   among sociologists working in the colonies, current discussions of
   postcolonial sociology question the applicability of Western social
   scientific concepts and theories to the global South and ask how
   sociology itself has been shaped by empire. Current sociological
   research on empires focuses on six sets of causal mechanisms: (1)
   capitalism; (2) geopolitics, war, and violence; (3) cultural
   representations and subjectivity; (4) resistance and collaboration by
   the colonized; (5) institutional dimensions of empires and colonies; and
   (6) conflict and compromise among colonizers at the heart of colonial
   states.

   designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present

   of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between

AB Interorganizational relationships connect people affiliated with
   organizations rather than corporate actors themselves. The managers and
   owners of organizations therefore do not always control these
   connections and consequently often cannot profit from them. We discuss
   the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own
   these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by
   them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the
   extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual
   (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel
   greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c)
   the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We
   discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these
   distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on
   the surface, and call for future research to pay closer attention to
   these issues.

AB The classical sociology of parties was born alongside parties
   themselves. It explored their dynamic interrelationships with states and
   society, as well as the tensions inherent in the fact that parties are
   simultaneously representatives and power seekers. Despite these rich
   foundations, from the 1960s the sociological approach came to be
   narrowly identified with a one-dimensional conception of parties, and
   political sociologists focused their attention elsewhere. This review
   contributes to efforts that began in the 1990s to reclaim the political
   party as a full-fledged sociological object. To this end, we track the
   hourglass-shaped trajectory of the sociology of parties: from broad
   Marxian and Weberian roots, to narrowing and near-eclipse after the
   1960s, to a reemergence that reclaims the breadth of the classical
   traditions. We conclude by suggesting six lines of inquiry that we
   believe would be fruitful, emphasizing both classical concerns that
   deserve more attention and innovative approaches that point in novel
   directions.

AB This article reviews recent research in fiscal sociology. We
   specifically examine contributions to the study of taxation that
   illuminate core issues in the sociology of contemporary capitalism,
   including the causes of poverty and inequality in rich countries and of
   inequality between rich and poor countries. Research on developed
   countries suggests that tax policy changes are important for explaining
   rising income inequality, tax policies may structure durable
   inequalities of race and gender, and earnings-conditional tax subsidies
   may alleviate poverty more effectively and with less stigma than
   means-tested social spending. Scholars also find the most generous
   welfare states rely the most heavily on regressive taxes, although there
   is disagreement over how this association arises. Comparative research
   on developing countries shows consumption taxes are more conducive to
   growth than taxes on income, tax-financed spending benefits growth if it
   is spent on productive investments, and taxation strengthened democracy
   and state building in medieval and early modern Europe. However, there
   is disagreement as to whether taxation contributes to state building in
   contemporary developing countries and whether foreign aid undermines
   democracy by undermining taxation. These questions are the focus of
   considerable current research.

   and (c) the collective response to HIV/AIDS through community-based

   Sociologists have pursued inquiry in all of these areas and have often
   advanced the implicit and explicit use of approaches that reveal the
   epidemic's embedded power relations. Previous research and the dynamics
   of the epidemic suggest a fundamental argument: HIV/AIDS is an epidemic
   of intersectional inequality that is fueled by racial, gender, class,
   and sexual inequities at the macro-structural, meso-institutional, and
   micro-interpersonal levels. These inequalities significantly shape the
   likelihood of exposure to the virus; the realities of living with the
   infection; and medical, programmatic, political, and social-scientific
   responses.

   discuss ways in which women in industrial cities challenged the ideology

   modernism of the same era, and in the third section, I explore how that
   urban structure limited women's opportunities outside the home. In the

   beyond masculine and feminine categories to include lesbians, gays, and
   transgender individuals. The article ends with a review of how women's
   and gay rights movements, gentrification, and planning practices have
   shaped a more gender-neutral contemporary metropolis.

AB Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite
   immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist
   discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a
   race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum
   participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use
   color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads
   (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind
   discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric
   of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees
   forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This
   neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance,
   which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby
   participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While
   color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white
   and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to
   include nonwhite immigrants.

AB Glaeser and Vigdor (2012) recently declared 'the end of a segregated

   has allegedly achieved transcendence over racism. After all, the authors
   note, government no longer endorses housing discrimination, all-white
   neighborhoods are extinct, and white racial attitudes have liberalized.
   Despite the proclamation, many questions regarding segregation remain
   unanswered by Glaeser and Vigdor. Namely, how can segregation be
   conceptualized and its measurement improved, what might alternative
   methods for analyzing it yield, and why does it matter in the first
   place? To prompt an overdue substantive and methodological discussion,
   we undertake a case study analysis of Cook County, Illinois to address
   these questions. Our analytic goal is to illuminate how segregation is a
   much more complex matter than many analyses reflect, and when this is
   taken into account, it becomes readily apparent that any assertions of
   racial transcendence are quite premature.

   Institutional Transformation program with the primary objective of
   increasing the participation and advancement of women at American
   Universities in all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   disciplines. Although ADVANCE has been received very well, its effects
   have been uneven among institutions receiving the ADVANCE grant. In this
   paper, we reflect on the NSF's goals for ADVANCE and initiatives ADVANCE
   schools undertake to increase gender equity in the context of gender
   organizations theory. Specifically, we comment on tensions that emerged
   through our own research concerning the relationship between feminist
   objectives of equity and justice and the nature of the ADVANCE program
   and transformational initiatives. We conclude by raising the perennial
   feminist question: 'Can the master's tools dismantle the master's

AB This article utilizes an auto-ethnographic approach to consider some of
   the tensions inherent in the requirements of sociology as an industry.
   Short production timelines, high expected output, and classical notions
   of objectivity continue to organize sociological inquiry, even as
   critical sociologists continue to question these very relations of
   ruling. This essay contributes to ongoing critical analyses of
   sociology's disciplinary paradigm and offers a consideration of the
   interstitial spaces potentially produced by 'slow sociology' as one
   possible antidote to these limitations. Productive of a borderlands
   epistemology, slow sociology resists the ruling relations of sociology
   and encourages nuanced translation work between cultures of study,
   cultures of habitation, and cultures of disciplined inquiry, fostering
   links between public society and academic endeavors.

   social shocks including the Civil War and emancipation of enslaved
   blacks. The person singularly cited as the architect of this area of
   study is Howard W. Odum. Although Odumis identified as the person most
   responsible for the development of this field, archival data indicate
   that W. E. B. Du Bois and the men and women of the Atlanta Sociological
   Laboratory were its first practitioners. In this paper evidence is
   offered to show that Du Bois's Atlanta University efforts predated
   Odum's North Carolina research program. Additionally, an explanation for
   Du Bois's marginalization in the existing sociology of the South

AB Sacrificing individual material interests for collective benefits
   involves trust that others will act in good faith. Inherent to
   situations concerning collective goods is the problem of the free rider
   that plagues collective action: the individual who maximizes their
   short-term interests at the cost of the greater good. Prior research in
   environmental sociology has identified various social structural factors
   predicting pro-environmental behavior and concern, while research on
   social dilemmas has explored the role of trust in determining
   cooperation in situations regarding collective goods. This research
   draws upon these areas of scholarship to examine the interaction between
   free rider fears with education, income, and ideology in determining the
   willingness of Americans to sacrifice individual interest for
   environmental protection through an analysis of 2010 General Social
   Survey data. Findings help differentiate the engagement of
   pro-environmental behavior from general environmental concern, with the
   fear of free riders particularly impacting the highly educated and
   ideological liberals.

   of graduate instructors, drawing on interview and focus group data from
   35 sociology students in a doctoral program at a large university in the

   felt a great deal of anxiety due to challenges they faced when teaching
   their own course for the first time: challenges such as feelings of
   unpreparedness, constant and unremitting time demands, problems with
   students, a lack of confidence, and insufficient support. Instructors
   employed a number of informal strategies in attempts to mediate the
   personal and professional impact of these challenges. Strategies
   included adjusting expectations, making sacrifices, becoming savvy, and
   creating informal peer networks that provided social support and
   increased access to resources. Findings indicate the need for
   institutional-level changes, including how graduate student teaching is
   viewed within the discipline and the ways graduate instructors are
   supported and prepared to teach. This article concludes with specific

   of teaching anxiety and teacher efficacy, may be of use for sociology

   a newly established teaching seminar using the Teaching Anxiety Scale
   and a Teaching Confidence Scale. Findings from pre- and posttest data
   show that the seminar lowered graduate students' feelings of anxiety
   about teaching for the first time and increased their levels of
   confidence regarding mastery of common pedagogical skills. Qualitative
   feedback from evaluations further illustrates the positive effects of
   the seminar on students' senses of themselves as teachers and their

   critical component of doctoral programs in sociology. Many universities
   and departments have instituted a single course, course sequence, or
   certification program dedicated to the preparation of future academic
   faculty. This article evaluates the efficacy of one such program, and
   asks two questions: (1) What are the most useful aspects of the
   Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program? (2) Is participation in the PFF
   program associated with greater job satisfaction, confidence, or
   competence? Qualitative data from Indiana University alumni suggest that
   the program is beneficial for exposing students to pedagogical
   knowledge, encouraging professionalization, and providing
   institutionalized support in the form of peer and faculty mentorship.
   Quantitative data indicate that although PFF participants were not
   significantly more satisfied or confident than their nonparticipating
   peers, the PFF program did appear to help to make participants feel more
   competent in their first jobs.

   incorporating teaching and learning into the curriculum: integrating
   pedagogy into substantive seminars. Teaching-infused graduate seminars
   are a great way to transmit norms, values, and common practices of the
   department to graduate students, and they allow for discussions of
   particular substantive challenges that graduate student instructors may
   face when teaching undergraduates about privilege, inequality,
   discrimination, and social structure. I describe my approach and present
   qualitative evaluations of this approach from two semesters of graduate
   students who have taken one of these seminars.

   templates of how to best mentor graduate students, especially in the
   vital area of teaching, are lacking. This article outlines the mentoring
   model called From Conception to Co-instructor to Completion (FCCIC).
   This five-step method provides a plan of action for faculty and graduate
   students who wish to co-develop a course in such a way that graduate
   student mentees are exposed to the entire teaching process with the
   supervision and assistance of a faculty mentor. This relationship moves
   beyond the traditional professor/teaching assistant hierarchy (the TA
   model) to create equally operational co-instructors. In this note, the
   FCCIC method is summarized and then illustrated through the development
   of a sociology course on happiness as an exemplar of how to better
   mentor graduate students in teaching.

   on (1) supply-side,' (2) neo-orthodox secularization, and (3)
   historicist schools, the authors develop a synthetic explanatory
   framework which emphasizes changed conditions of religious belonging
   amid the transition to modernity. Modernization, they suggest, disrupted
   older, parochialized forms of religious community which emerged in the
   Middle Ages. The authors describe the rise and diffusion of newer,
   de-parochialized forms of religious belonging and organization in the
   18th and 19th centuries and stress their comparative compatibility with
   modernity; here the authors draw special attention to the impact of
   missionary organizational schemas derived in colonial environments and
   re-purposed for domestic evangelism. They argue that mass unchurching
   was positively related to the persistence of parochialism and negatively
   related to the spread of post-parochialism. The salient comparison is
   therefore not merely between Western Europe and the US, but rather
   between national cases in which de-parochialization accompanied
   political and economic modernization and those in which it did not.

AB Childhood scholars have found that age inequality can be as profound an
   axis of meaningful difference as race, gender, or class, and yet the
   impact of this understanding has not permeated the discipline of
   sociology as a whole. This is one particularly stark example of the
   central argument of this article: despite decades of empirical and
   theoretical work by scholars in "the social studies of childhood,"
   sociologists in general have not incorporated the central contributions
   of this subfield: that children are active social agents (not passive),
   knowing actors strategizing within their constraints (not innocent),
   with their capacities and challenges shaped by their contexts (not
   universally the same). I contend that mainstream sociology's relative
   imperviousness has led to theoretical costs for both childhood
   scholars-who must re-assert and re-prove the core insights of the
   field-and sociologists in general. Using three core theoretical debates
   in the larger discipline-about independence, insecurity, and
   inequality-I argue that children's perspectives can help scholars ask
   new questions, render the invisible visible, and break through
   theoretical logjams. Thus would further research utilizing children's
   perspectives and the dynamics of age extend the explanatory power of
   social theory.

   compatible with Marx's over time. Third, I point out ambiguities in
   Bourdieu's concept of capital that, despite gestures toward a Marxist
   understanding of capital, further distance him from Marx. Fourth, I
   argue that Bourdieu tends to take the economic field and economic
   capital for granted, unlike Marx. I conclude that if different forms of

   which tracks permutations of specific land-use transitions over time. In
   a fixed-effects analysis, the area of cropland lost to the built
   environment is regressed on different measures of population and
   economic growth. Results indicate that natural increase and net
   migration differentially affect the loss of cropland at the local level
   across the continental United States, challenging the traditional focus
   in environmental sociology on overall population growth. This study also
   advances the concept of aristocratic conservation as a process by which
   increasing residential affluence slows down the intensification of land.
   The results of the analysis are discussed in terms of what land-use

   illustrate my argument, this paper is organized into four sections.
   First, the applicability and extension of Bourdieu's theory of cultural
   production is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating
   how the concept of location adopts an intersubjective understanding of
   reflexivity in order to address some of the limitations of Bourdieu's
   concepts of position, disposition and strategy. Second, two different
   strategies of legitimation (crowd pleasing and crowd commanding) adopted
   by DJs within the field are outlined. Third, the importance of location
   in the use of these strategies in the field of black popular
   music-making is illustrated. Finally, this paper concludes by
   summarizing the key dimensions of the concept of location and suggesting
   how the concept has broader applicability in other cultural fields.

AB Social studies of agriculture tend to overlook the micro and symbolic
   interactions that structure relationships among agriculturalists, the
   environment, and animals raised as commodities. In this study, I use
   ethnographic methods and in-depth interviews with conventional beef
   producers to understand their perceptions of the environment and the
   nonhuman animals they raise. Central themes in this setting are the
   ethics of stewardship and husbandry. I seek to understand how these
   values are constructed and used interactionally. I argue that
   stewardship and husbandry help describe a process of co-constitution
   that binds together ranchers, cattle, and the natural environment. The
   analysis engages actor-network theory by emphasizing nonhuman activeness
   and draws from symbolic interaction and cultural sociology to show how
   people interpret the actions of nonhumans. The findings show that
   ranchers frame their relationships with cattle and the environment as
   symbiotic and work to understand the interests of the nonhuman as
   complementary to production. I introduce the term symbiotic ideology to
   show the way this approach mystifies power dynamics embedded in the
   ethic of dominion.

AB While most work on causation in ethnography addresses the normative
   question of what ethnographers should do, this article addresses the
   empirical question of what ethnographers actually do. Specifically, it
   investigates whether ethnographic articles make causal arguments and how
   these arguments are made. The authors draw on a content analysis of 48
   ethnographic articles sampled from four groups of sociological journals:
   contemporary generalist journals, contemporary specialist journals,
   mid-20th-century generalist journalsall in the United Statesand
   contemporary generalist journals in Mexico. They find that ethnographies
   in U.S. contemporary generalist journals are most likely to advance
   strong and central causal claims and to use logical and rhetorical
   devices comparable to those used in quantitative articles. They also
   find that most Mexican ethnographic articles undertake a different kind
   of project, which they call "shedding light" on social phenomena. In
   addition to offering one methodological and one substantive suggestion
   to account for these findings, the authors highlight their implications
   for the sociology of social science.

AB This study advances recent theorizing on causality and emergence by
   analyzing how new activist groups create a collective sense of plausible
   tactics. A comparative ethnographic approach is used to observe shifts
   in the discussions of four fledgling activist groups. In each group,
   implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events,
   authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge
   without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group's
   sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new
   understanding of the role of contingency in collective activism and a
   method for using ethnographic observation to locate subtle causal
   mechanisms in social life.

AB This article reports the results of a study of the impact of two kinds
   of mentoring, as in individual, instrumental mentoring by white male
   advisors versus supportive/communal, homophilous (same race/ethnicity)
   mentoring on the likelihood of minority scholars having an ideal or
   archetypal career trajectory when compared to two other control groups.
   Using unobtrusive data, we test a series of hypotheses concerning the
   likelihood of attaining selected aspects of an ideal career including
   employment at a research-extensive institution, scholarly publications,
   tenure, grants, and disciplinary recognition. We find that having a
   white male instrumental advisor increases the likelihood of having an
   ideal career for participants in the American Sociological Association's
   (ASA) national pre-doctoral Minority Fellowship Program (MFP) who have
   the advantage of having access to both types of mentoring when compared
   to a random group of largely white PhDs.

AB In transitions from state socialism, property rights are re-allocated to
   organizations and groups, creating new markets and new forms of economic
   enterprise that reshape the stratification order. A generation of
   research has estimated individual-level outcomes with income equations
   and mobility models, relying on broad assumptions about economic change.
   We redirect attention to the process of economic change that structures
   emerging markets. The process varies across market sectors, depending on
   the entity that is granted rights formerly exercised by state organs,
   and on the combination of rights they are granted. The transformation of
   three sectors in China-agriculture, steel manufacturing, and real
   estate-shows how different allocations of property rights alter the
   stratification order in strikingly different ways. Historical analysis
   of the evolution of markets and enterprises integrates insights from
   economic sociology into research on social stratification, providing a
   structural perspective on transitions from state socialism.

   Africa: the Axial religions (Christianity and Islam); indigenous
   chieftaincy systems based around chief, lineage, and clan; and
   globalized modernity, represented primarily by NGOs and the global human
   rights agenda. The article argues that in many respects it is the Axial
   religions that are the most modernizing, as they directly counter the
   power of traditional kin obligations (and the overwhelming dangers of
   witchcraft), while the purportedly modern and secular NGOs practice a
   ritualized version of modernity, even as they are penetrated by the
   norms and practices of the kin-based chieftaincy system and its related
   system of patron-client ties.

   la figure du chef, de la lignee et du clan ; et la modernite a l'ere
   globale, essentiellement representee par les ONG et l'action mondiale en
   faveur des droits de l'homme. Nous avancons qu'a bien des egards, ce
   sont les religions << axiales >> qui sont les plus porteuses de
   modernite, dans la mesure oU elles s'opposent directement a l'influence
   des obligations familiales traditionnelles (et aux immenses dangers que
   recele la sorcellerie), tandis que les ONG, pretendument modernes et

   el linaje y el clan; y la modernidad globalizada, representada
   principalmente por las ONGs y la agenda mundial de los derechos humanos.
   El articulo sostiene que, en muchos aspectos son las religiones axiales
   las mas modernizadoras, ya que contrapesan directamente el poder de las
   obligaciones de parentesco tradicionales (y los abrumadores peligros de
   la brujeria), mientras que las ONGs supuestamente modernas y seculares

AB Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of
   difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest
   these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the
   commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively
   shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and
   transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent
   State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and
   participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I
   theorize the existence of a third commemorative formthe integrated
   commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent
   narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while
   simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared
   meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or
   scientific inquiry.

AB Simulation games can help overcome student resistance to thinking
   structurally about social class inequality, meritocracy, and mobility.
   Most inequality simulations focus solely on economic inequality and omit
   social and cultural capital, both of which contribute to social class
   reproduction. Using a pretest/posttest design, the current study
   evaluates a simulation game that incorporates economic, social, and
   cultural capital and is meant for introductory sociology classes
   containing between 15 and 70 students. Data come from a state research
   university and a liberal arts college. Results show that the simulation
   increased students' conceptual understanding of structural explanations
   for restricted mobility; cultural and social capital; and conceptual
   connections between stratification concepts. The simulation did not lead
   to changes in students' feelings about poor people. Results support the
   idea of using simulation games to overcome student resistance to the
   sociological perspective on stratification and suggest that some
   simulation games may be effective across institutional contexts.

AB A common source of frustration for college instructors is getting their
   students to read. Since the 1970s, studies have shown that no more than
   30 percent of students complete a reading assignment on any given day.
   But what can be done? What strategies can instructors use to make
   certain that their students read? Do pop or announced quizzes work
   better? Does it help to call on students randomly in class? To date,
   little systematic evidence exists concerning the relative utility of the
   many methods instructors use to encourage reading compliance. This study
   begins to address that lacuna. Specifically, using survey data collected
   in introductory sociology classes (N = 423), we examine how students
   evaluate seven commonly used methods ranging from announced quizzes to
   short writing assignments to being called on randomly in class. We find
   that students perceive mandatory and/or announced methods to be more
   effective in motivating them to complete reading assignments than
   unannounced or optional methods.

   students' attention; fosters a nonthreatening learning environment;
   raises students' awareness of personal perspectives and biases; and
   encourages integration of ideas and critical thinking. ARC can also be
   used for meaningful assessment between formal evaluations as well as to
   reward each student's preparation and reading of the class material. The
   principles, practice, benefits, and measures of success of ARC as an

   develop an account of the relational, discursive, and performative
   dimensions of power. Each proposed dimension of power is grounded in a
   different understanding of social causes: relational-realist,
   discursive-hermeneutic, and performative-pragmatic. For the purposes of
   empirical analysis, this dimensional schema crosscuts the classic
   sources of power typology developed by Michael Mann and others, thus
   rendering the conceptual apparatus for pursuing sociological research on
   power more complex and explanatorily effective. The schema is
   illustrated by an example from comparative-historical sociology:
   explaining the storming of the Bastille and its effects. A series of
   research questions for investigating the relative autonomy of
   performative power is proposed. Finally, the current schema is situated
   vis-a-vis classic sociological theories of power, including the

AB Social network research is widely considered atheoretical. In contrast,
   in this article I argue that network analysis often mixes two distinct
   theoretical frameworks, creating a logically inconsistent foundation.
   Relationalism rejects essentialism and a priori categories and insists
   upon the intersubjectivity of experience and meaning as well as the
   importance of the content of interactions and their historical setting.
   Formalism is based on a structuralist interpretation of the theoretical
   works of Georg Simmel. Simmel laid out a neo-Kantian program of
   identifying a priori categories of relational types and patterns that
   operate independently of cultural content or historical setting.
   Formalism and relationalism are internally consistent theoretical
   perspectives, but there are tensions between them. To pave the way for
   stronger middle-range theoretical development, I disaggregate the two
   approaches and highlight the contradictions that must be addressed or
   resolved for the construction of any general and inclusive theory.

   key problems dogging the consumption literature. The budgetary unit
   concept ((1)) offers a new framework for theorizing and better
   accounting for observed consumption patterns, ((2)) reveals how
   consumption units have organizational logics, preferences, strengths,
   and vulnerabilities that are consequentially distinct from market logic
   of production and profit, and ((3)) focuses attention on social
   processes and features enabling theorization of general social patterns
   of consumption across diverse contexts. This article highlights the

   approach using the conventionally dissimilar cases of Russian organized

AB Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together
   increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation
   faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to
   be established disproportionately between those sharing significant
   social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author
   explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup
   relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar
   others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on
   interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S.
   dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on
   educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on
   marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for
   the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a
   two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its
   empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the
   homophily hurdle.

AB How does an object in the ground become a discovery on the ground? This
   paper analyzes how archaeologists produce the content and status of a
   discovery before it is unearthed, a phenomenon I call "prospective
   loading." It includes intense social knowledge of the soil, a form of
   embodied knowledge that I call "dirt sense". These forces and mechanisms
   do not always work together harmoniously. Qualitative data from three
   excavations demonstrate how deep sensory perception thrives alongside
   sophisticated technology, and is construed as vital to the discovery
   process. The case has implications for how we think about cultural
   knowledge in scientific work and theorize the role of nationalism and
   politics in archaeology.

AB Using the 1957-2011 data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, I
   integrate the gender relations theory, a life course perspective, and a
   biosocial stress perspective to explore the effect of women's job
   authority in 1975 (at age 36) and 1993 (at age 54) on breast cancer
   incidence up to 2011. Findings indicate that women with the authority to
   hire, fire, and influence others' pay had a significantly higher risk of
   a breast cancer diagnosis over the next thirty years compared to
   housewives and employed women with no job authority. Because job
   authority conferred the highest risk of breast cancer for women who also
   spent more hours dealing with people at work in 1975,1 suggest that the
   assertion of job authority by women in the 1970 s involved stressful
   interpersonal experiences, such as social isolation and negative social
   interactions, that may have increased the risk of breast cancer via
   prolonged dysregulation of the glucocorticoid system and exposure of
   breast tissue to the adverse effects of chronically elevated cortisol.
   This study contributes to sociology by emphasizing gendered biosocial
   pathways through which women's occupational experiences become embodied
   and drive forward physiological repercussions.

AB Building on a recent theoretical development in the field of
   sociological social psychology, we develop a formal mathematical model
   of social influence processes. The extant theoretical literature implies
   that factions and status should have non-linear effects on social
   influence, and yet these theories have been evaluated using standard
   linear statistical models. Our formal model of influence includes these
   non-linearities, as specified by the theories. We evaluate the fit of
   the formal model using experimental data. Our results indicate that a
   one-parameter mathematical model fits the experimental data. We conclude
   with the implications of our research and a discussion of how it may be

AB American sociology as a field tends to marginalize psychoanalytic
   perspectives despite scholars Cavalletto and Silver showing that this
   was not the case during Talcott Parson's intellectual heyday in the
   1940s. From the 1970s on, though, constructionists emphasized the
   conservative rather than liberatory side of the Freudian tradition and
   symbolic interactionism took the place of psychoanalysis as the
   legitimized framework for understanding individuals. Marginalization has
   occurred for at least three reasons: (1) the legacies of positivism
   created a bias toward empirically observable rather than relatively
   unmeasurable concepts like the Freudian unconscious; (2) psychoanalysis
   uses internal data whereas sociologists look externally rather than
   inward; (3) because psychoanalysis focuses on individuals and sociology
   on groups, it is argued that the two are incommensurate. Nevertheless,
   even in the face of marginalization, some scholars have combined
   psychoanalytic and sociological perspectives in myriad ways conceiving
   of multi dimensional rather than rationalistic individuals within social
   and cultural settings; exploring interactional dynamics that are at once
   psychic-and-social; and, as in the work of Wilfred Bion, studying the
   psychoanalytic mechanisms of groups themselves. I posit that the ongoing
   marginalization of psychoanalysis deprives the discipline of an
   innovative tool of analysis, an especially salient one at times when the
   emotional and psychological dimensions of social life are glaringly
   evident.

AB Science on emerging environmental health threats involves numerous
   ethical concerns related to scientific uncertainty about conducting,
   interpreting, communicating, and acting upon research findings, but the
   connections between ethical decision making and scientific uncertainty
   are under-studied in sociology. Under conditions of scientific
   uncertainty, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed by formal
   ethical codes of conduct, increasing the importance of ethical
   reflection by researchers, conflicts over research conduct, and reliance
   on informal ethical standards. This article draws on in-depth interviews
   with scientists, regulators, activists, industry representatives, and
   fire safety experts to explore ethical considerations of moments of
   uncertainty using a case study of flame retardants, chemicals widely
   used in consumer products with potential negative health and
   environmental impacts. We focus on the uncertainty that arises in
   measuring people's exposure to these chemicals through testing of their
   personal environments or bodies. We identify four sources of ethical
   concerns relevant to scientific uncertainty: 1) choosing research
   questions or methods, 2) interpreting scientific results, 3)
   communicating results to multiple publics, and 4) applying results for
   policy making. This research offers lessons about professional conduct
   under conditions of uncertainty, ethical research practice,
   democratization of scientific knowledge, and science's impact on policy.

AB This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting
   for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners'
   narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on
   narrative identity and drawing on 15months of fieldwork and 25 in-depth
   interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities
   in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative
   conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative:
   what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the
   process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally
   continuous and essentialized Pagan self. I suggest that while all
   conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different
   faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress
   self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the
   rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1)
   perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to
   legitimacy and social acceptance; and (3) understanding of the nature of
   religious truth.

AB Security as a phenomenon has come to occupy increasing social energy and
   thus merits sociological attention. But the question of how to go about
   studying security is somewhat vexing, because the concept of security is
   both highly polysemous (Ranasinghe 2013) and one that can potentially be
   located within a wide spectrum of social sites, ranging from the
   feelings of individuals to the practices of states. I suggest that we
   must first clarify what we are talking about when we talk about
   security. Here, I present several ideas for fully articulating the
   concept.

AB Gender performativity has had significant influences in cultural studies
   and sociology, yet empirical cases of the theory remain scarce. While
   some analysis examines performativity in work, the focus is on
   organizations and how gender gets done and undone' within them with
   little attention paid to bodies outside organizations. Based on two
   empirical studies of freelancing fashion models, we extend Butler's
   gender performativity to analyse the routine bodily practices and gender
   performances of men and women in fashion, investigating what happens
   when men and women perform the same work but under different gendered
   expectations. Fashion modelling presents a case that reproduces
   heteronormative definitions of femininity while potentially challenging
   traditional notions of masculinity and work. Observing everyday
   transgressions', we evidence how gender performativity, while largely
   reiterative of normative heterosexuality, may subtly confound the
   conventions. Observing how models do and undo' gender extends the
   analysis of gender at work to non-organizational bodies that tend to be
   under-represented within the literature.

AB Theorizing the social influence of racism and race has long been a
   concern of sociologists. Theories have addressed how racism, race and
   race inequality are organized and changed. Yet they have not addressed
   why racism and race are persistent despite social change. A social
   process theory of racism and race is proposed that analyzes their
   flexibility and persistence. It posits that racism is a social process
   where the meanings of race identities are traded across macro, meso, and
   micro levels of society. These trades legitimate social policies, are
   used to define a society as moral, and inform experiences. Black and
   white identities in light of the civil rights movement and its
   retrenchment, and the post-9/11 identity of Muslim Americans provide
   examples for applying the theory. I discuss the implications of the
   social process theory of racism and race for the future of race
   inequality in American society and sociological research.

   difficult for students at historically white colleges and universities

   enter HWCUs surrounded by these walls - protecting them from attacks on
   white supremacy - that have multiple layers and therefore are even more
   difficult to penetrate; yet they must be penetrated. With a few
   exceptions, the institution of American higher education does not
   threaten those walls. Instead, college education often bolsters them
   through curricular and extracurricular experiences, residential and
   disciplinary isolation, institutional symbols, cultural reproduction,
   and everyday practices such as grading and classroom interactions. We

AB National human rights institutions, defined as domestic but globally
   legitimated agencies charged with promoting and protecting human rights,
   have emerged worldwide. This article examines the effect of these
   organizations on two kinds of human rights outcomes: physical integrity
   rights and civil and political rights. We analyze cross-national
   longitudinal data using regression models that account for the
   endogeneity of organizational formation. Our first main finding is that
   all types of human rights institutions improve long-term physical
   integrity outcomes but not civil and political rights practices. This
   finding may reflect a greater worldwide focus on physical integrity
   violations such as torture, and also many countries' propensity to
   resist Western civil and political rights standards. A second main
   finding is that time matters: in the cases we observe, initial increases
   in rated abuse levels were followed by improvements. These initial
   increases may be due to closer scrutiny or the expanded scope of what
   constitutes human rights abuses. Our results call for rethinking the
   concept of decoupling in the sociology of human rights and other focal
   areas.

AB The traditional jurisprudential model of law views the application of
   legal sanctions primarily as a function of the facts of the case and the
   rules that govern the proceedings. Sociology of law scholars have
   challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that
   law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader
   considerations of community social organization and collective
   sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and
   severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social
   capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more
   prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find
   that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which
   the public expresses higher levels of fear. Overall, the findings
   provide provocative evidence that legal outcomes in murder cases are
   influenced by several features of the social environments in which they
   are processed.

   relations form and are structured by social institutions. Using data

   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors show that
   the odds of a new friendship nomination were 1.77 times greater within
   clusters of high school students taking courses together than between
   them. The estimated effect cannot be attributed to exposure to peers in
   similar grade levels, indirect friendship links, or pair-level course
   overlap, and the finding is robust to alternative model specifications.
   The authors also show how tendencies associated with status hierarchy
   inhering in triadic friendship nominations are neutralized within the

   distribution of social capital within social systems such as schools,
   giving the clusters social salience as local positions.

AB Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of democratic politics that is at
   least as indebted to civic republicanism as to Marxism. He was familiar
   with the civic republican tradition, and it increasingly influenced both
   his political interventions and sociological work, especially late in
   his career. Bourdieu drew above all on Niccol Machiavelli's version of
   republicanism, though the French republican tradition also influenced
   him via Durkheimian social theory. Three elements of Bourdieu's work in
   particular-his concept of field autonomy, his view of interests and
   universalism, and his understanding of how solidarity is generated and
   sustained-may be understood, at least in part, as sociological
   reformulations of republican ideas. By drawing attention to these
   republican influences, the article aims to show that the conceptual
   resources which some critics, including Jeffrey C. Alexander, consider
   indispensable to an adequate theory of democracy are not entirely absent
   in Bourdieu's work. On the basis of this reassessment, the article
   concludes that Bourdieu and Alexander are not as opposed in their
   thinking about democratic politics as it might first appear.

   introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students,
   and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our
   students are, how the course fits with university mission and program
   goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can
   build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is
   alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in
   sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and
   curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in
   recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the
   major. Posing such questions will promote further discussion and

AB Focus group interviewing is widely used by academic and applied
   researchers. Given the popularity and strengths of this method, it is
   surprising how rarely focus group interviewing is taught in the
   undergraduate classroom and how few resources exist to support
   instructors who wish to train students to use this technique. This
   article fills the gap in the teaching and learning literature in
   sociology by addressing focus group research. I describe how to
   integrate a complete research project with student-led focus groups into
   a single semester course. I outline the various stages involved in the
   research process and then consider how this approach enhances three
   specific areas: learning, teaching, and scholarship. The effectiveness
   of the focus group project was assessed through a one-group
   pretest-posttest survey of the student-researchers' experiences. I
   conclude with a reflection on the practical limitations as well as the
   considerable advantages of training students to conduct focus group
   research.

AB Although there is widespread agreement among academics that critical
   thinking is an important component to the college classroom, there is
   little empirical evidence to verify that it is being taught in courses.
   Using four sections of introductory sociology, we developed an
   experimental design using pretests and posttests to assess students'
   critical thinking skills. Controlling for grade point average,
   cumulative credit hours completed, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
   status, instructor, and initial levels of critical thinking, being in
   the experimental group had a statistically significant impact on
   critical thinking at the end of the semester. Thus, inclusion of writing
   assignments and classroom discussion designed to enhance creative
   thought processes for the experimental group helped students improve
   from one-dimensional thinking toward more multistructural analysis.

AB This article describes and evaluates the Gender Attitude and Belief
   Inventory (GABI), a teaching tool designed to aid students in (a)
   realizing how sociological theory links to their personal beliefs and
   (b) exploring any combination of 11 frequently used theoretical
   perspectives on gender, including both conservative theories
   (physiological, sociobiological, and structural functionalist) and
   feminist ones (liberal, socialist, Marxist, radical, separatist,
   cultural, multicultural/black, and postmodern feminism). In this
   article, I discuss the inventory, how I use it in my sociology of gender
   class, and how it could be adapted for use in other classes. I also
   analyze qualitative and quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness
   based on responses from students at two universities (N = 603) and
   pretest and posttest results of its impact on student learning
   immediately following the activity (N = 161) and at the end of the
   semester (N = 33). These data suggest that the GABI increases students'
   understanding of theoretical perspectives on gender, encourages them to
   reflect on their own views and (mis)perceptions of theories, and is an
   engaging exercise for students. Most importantly, this is a valuable
   exercise to aid students in realizing how sociological theory links to
   their everyday lives.

AB Increasingly, colleges and universities are relying on fully online
   classes to teach students. This article investigates how students
   evaluate online courses in comparison to more traditional face-to-face
   courses. Data come from undergraduate student evaluations of 118
   sociology courses, and results of a series of hierarchical linear models
   indicate that students feel they have learned less in online courses,
   believe they are treated with more respect in in-class courses, and rate
   online courses less highly than in-class courses. Findings also suggest
   that the negative effects of teaching online are not universal for
   instructors, as the switch to online classes actually results in better
   evaluations for teachers who typically perform poorly in the classroom.
   These findings caution against the broad use of online sociology classes
   as a strategy for coping with increasing enrollments and shrinking
   budgets and suggest educators should select the course format that best
   complements their teaching strengths and skills.

   assessment of the efficacy of course portfolios by using a controlled,
   pretest-posttest analysis conducted in seven sections of three separate
   sociology courses. Third, we illustrate the conceptual connections
   between active learning pedagogy and identity theory and provide

AB Why do advocacy organizations focus on some issues rather than others?
   Issue selection is an important area of study given that advocacy
   organizations have limited time and resources and thus many potentially
   important issues go ignored. Yet issue selection remains an understudied
   question in the scholarly study of advocacy organizations. In this
   article, the author draws on historical data, interviews, and a database
   of statements by major human rights advocacy organizations to examine
   one particular historical puzzle regarding issue selection: why advocacy
   organizations have focused on the recent conflict in the Darfur region
   of Sudan rather than the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
   even though more people have died in the Congo. The author finds that
   advocacy organizations select issues not based on their severity but
   based on framing, political opportunities, and organizational resources.

   way partnership between middle schools in a poor largely Latino school
   district, the local University, and local after-school care providers.
   This paper assesses the project and situates it theoretically using
   Foucault's microphysics of power and Bourdieu's concepts of capital to
   analyze the refusal of most students and teachers to engage in the
   program and the standardized testing required by the state. We further
   articulate a new form of Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence based
   on position in the consumer hierarchy. We conclude with a critique of
   grant mechanisms as a means of addressing health issues, and situate the
   obesity epidemic as a social construction that perpetuates inequality
   and discourses of power.

AB Classic sociological theory emphasizing human ecology and the
   convergence of persons in time and space motivated the routine
   activities approach in criminological research. Empirical work in this
   tradition focuses on predatory offending, and it has rarely been
   considered as a theoretical basis for the study of more common,
   low-level (mostly nonviolent) deviance. Using commonplace automotive
   incivility as a test case, the present work draws on the routine
   activities approach in precisely this manner to answer recent
   theoretical calls for an empirical sociology of familiar encounters and
   situations. Using data from a nationally representative sample of
   Australians, this article looks at the time/space distribution,
   situational commonalities, and emotional consequences of vehicular
   incivilities. Risk factors consistent with the routine activities
   paradigm include everyday driving activity and microsituations involving
   mixed speeds, crowded conditions, and blocked flows. Results also
   suggest that automotive incivility is more likely than other types of
   incivility to incite feelings of fear and anger.

AB The biophysical environment is not tangential to the social; it is only
   tangential to conventional sociological thought. Environmental sociology
   arose in the 1970s based on this presupposition, but over time theory
   and empirical research have generally adopted a social constructionist
   or natural realist approach. Despite rejection of the Durkheimian dictum
   of explaining social facts through the invocation of other social facts,
   and thus refusal to presuppose human exemptionalism from ecological
   constraints, scholarship continues to reflect this nature/culture
   divide. When environmental sociologists focus on one side or the other
   of the nature/culture divide, the intertwining and conjoint constitution
   of the social and the biophysical-material is obscured. The intent of
   the present essay is to articulate a co-constructionist ontological
   position sensitive to the temporal emergence of hybridity between the
   social and the natural and amenable to recognition of salient dynamics
   not readily envisioned from either side of the nature/culture divide. In
   doing so, the argument builds upon prior metatheoretical scholarship in
   environmental sociology and science and technology studies and
   highlights ontological conundrums that must be confronted in order to
   further the move toward a viable co-constructionist posture.

AB The concept of the axial age, initially proposed by the philosopher Karl

   rise of major religious and philosophical figures and ideas throughout
   Eurasia, has gained an established position in a number of fields,
   including historical sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of
   religion. We explore whether the notion of an "axial age" has historical
   and intellectual cogency, or whether the authors who use the label of a
   more free-floating "axiality" to connote varied "breakthroughs" in human
   experience may have a more compelling case. Throughout, we draw
   attention to ways in which uses of the axial age concept in contemporary
   social science vary in these and other respects. In the conclusion, we
   reflect on the value of the concept and its current uses and their
   utility in making sense of human experience.

   sociology textbooks to determine the relationship between categories of
   gender, race, and class and levels of analysis. Previous research found
   that textbooks primarily discuss gender at the micro level, race at the
   meso level, and class at the macro level. Replicating previous
   approaches by using index citations, we find evidence that gender is
   linked to socialization much more than race and class, and there is
   evidence that class is still more likely to be discussed at a macro
   level. Our content analysis findings show a similar pattern, but also
   some evidence for the increased inclusion of theories and examples that
   examine gender, race, and class at multiple levels of analysis.
   Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for
   race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in
   colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a
   pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian
   world than exists in reality and includes claims that U.S. society is
   now "post-racial." Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an
   era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social
   distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider
   "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white
   supremacy and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume
   exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must
   employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify
   their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain
   racial inequality at the systemic level. I introduce one successful
   approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial
   inequality by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital
   acquisition and transfer.

   created an image-based learning model to address this disconnect. I used
   discussion board image selection, posting and critique exercises
   (image-posts), and personal meaning maps (PMMs) as core assignments.
   This combination increased student comprehension, challenged and altered
   perceptions of key topics, and gave them a greater sense of agency
   through reflexive learning. Additionally, students' reception of this
   model was favorable, with 97 percent reporting that the course met or

AB Scholarship on teaching undergraduates increasingly emphasizes the
   benefits of providing students with an active role in their education
   whereby instructors are more aptly described as facilitators of

   recommendations from the American Sociological Association aimed
   specifically at the undergraduate sociology curriculum argue that
   students must engage as practitioners of sociology at each level of
   their program development. In short, undergraduates should do
   sociology-not just read or write sociology. Applying this recommendation
   to teaching statistics, I suggest organizing a course around a
   student-led research project in which students generate the topics,
   questions, and data that are then used to complete a substantive
   research paper. Students are given the opportunity to be actively
   engaged in all stages of the research and data-gathering process.
   Students also present their work in student roundtables, further

AB Social epidemiologists Marmot and Wilkinson argue that relative
   deprivation is the dominant mechanism through which socioeconomic status
   (SES) affects mortality. If such an argument is valid, we would expect
   to consistently see the influence of relative deprivation in situations
   where two or more highly qualified and very similar individuals are
   nominated in a status competition, but only one receives the status
   boost conferred by winning. We studied mortality experiences of Emmy
   Award winners, Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, and presidents and vice
   presidents-comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition.
   Our findings and results of similar studies fail to show consistent
   advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is
   sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent. We
   conclude that the critical processes determining the strength and
   direction of any status effect on longevity are changes in life
   circumstances that result from winning or losing, rather than the
   processes that inexorably flow from one's relative position in a status
   hierarchy.

AB Contemporary scholarship has conceptualized modern fame as an open
   system in which people continually move in and out of celebrity status.
   This model stands in stark contrast to the traditional notion in the
   sociology of stratification that depicts stable hierarchies sustained
   through classic forces such as social structure and cumulative
   advantage. We investigate the mobility of fame using a unique data
   source containing daily records of references to person names in a large
   corpus of English-language media sources. These data reveal that only at
   the bottom of the public attention hierarchy do names exhibit fast
   turnover; at upper tiers, stable coverage persists around a fixed level
   and rank for decades. Fame exhibits strong continuity even in
   entertainment, on television, and on blogs, where it has been thought to
   be most ephemeral. We conclude that once a person's name is decoupled
   from the initial event that lent it momentary attention,
   self-reinforcing processes, career structures, and commemorative
   practices perpetuate fame.

   United States. New organizations and websites are cropping up, a
   wellspring of books are being published, and long-standing progressive
   writers and theologians are garnering more attention and support than
   ever before. Despite significant advances, however, the impact of the
   'religious left' in the American public sphere is still limited. In this
   paper, I ask why. Based on participant observation, discourse analysis,
   and in-depth interviews, and using a multidimensional culturalist
   perspective rooted in Durkheimian and Weberian ideas, I explore the
   symbolic dynamics of the Christian 'left'. I argue that in addition to
   their structural disadvantages, progressive Christians face thorny
   dilemmas regarding authority/legitimacy, rationalization,
   demystification, disenchantment, charisma (or the lack thereof), and
   profanation that, though not insurmountable, are not easily resolved.

   response to a 1999 book against irony, the declared 'death of irony'
   after the events of September 11, 2001, and concerns about the ironic
   nature of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. After reviewing the
   literature on irony from various academic disciplines, the author shows
   how 'knockers' worried that irony was a counter-narrative that would
   distract from romantic progress, while 'boosters' claimed irony was a
   trope that could only strengthen the romantic story of the nation.
   Rather than answering the title question, the author uses the evidence
   of these 'ironic crises' to show how such questions reveal the cultural
   forms and reflexivity that structure the American public sphere.

AB In the latter half of the 20th century, countries abolished the death
   penalty en masse. What factors help to explain this global trend?
   Conventional analyses explain abolition by focusing primarily on state
   level political processes. This article contributes to these studies by
   analyzing world cultural factors that lend to the abolition trend. The
   main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto
   cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of
   the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights
   regime, represents a significant driver of states' abolition. Countries'
   predominant religion is also found to significantly affect the
   probability of abolition: predominantly Catholic nation-states are most
   likely to abolish the death penalty, and predominantly Muslim
   nation-states are least likely to abolish. These findings provide
   evidence for world cultural factors that structure the abolition trend
   globally.

AB Comparative historical methods are used to explain the transformation of
   the U. S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The
   analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level
   narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but
   interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex
   interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps
   explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically,
   over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy,
   and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political
   innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to
   increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to
   respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In
   turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime
   control politics and policies at the national level that reflected
   historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.

AB A perennial concern among scholars of globalization is the relationship
   between global social formations and national and subnational political
   and economic developments. While sociological understanding of "the
   global" has become increasingly rich, stressing the complex relationship
   between material and cultural pressures, an undertheorized nation state
   often sits on the receiving end of the sociologist's model of
   globalization. The goal of this article is to help move the sociology of
   globalization out of the analytical trap of global-national dualism by
   developing an account of the transnationalization of political
   authority. Building on neo-Marxist and Weberian theories of the
   transnational, or global state, which explicate the macro-structural
   dynamics that have led to the transnationalization of the state as such,
   I look at the process of the transnationalization of political authority
   from an institutional perspective, one that focuses on processes of
   transnationalization within, and across, specific state agencies. These
   theoretical points are empirically motivated through an historical
   investigation of the transnationalization of monetary authority and its
   relationship to the international diffusion of policies of austerity
   from the era of the classical gold standard through the economic crisis
   of 2008.

AB While new scholarship on Pierre Bourdieu has recovered his early work on
   Algeria, this essay excavates his early thoughts on colonialism.
   Contrary to received wisdom, Bourdieu did in fact offer a theory of
   colonialism and a systematic understanding of its effects and logics.
   Bourdieu portrayed colonialism as a racialized system of domination,
   backed by force, which restructures social relations and creates hybrid
   cultures. His theory entailed insights on the limits and promises of
   colonial reform, anticolonial revolution, and postcolonial liberation.
   Bourdieu's early thinking on colonialism drew upon but extended French
   colonial studies of the time. It also contains the seeds of later
   concepts like habitus, field, and reflexive sociology while prefiguring
   more recent disciplinary postcolonial studies. Bourdieusian sociology in
   this sense originates not just as a study of Algeria but more
   specifically a critique of colonialism. It can be seen as contributing
   to the larger project of postcolonial sociology.

AB Historical scholarship suggests that a robust cult of the saints may
   have helped some European regions to resist inroads by Protestantism.
   Based on a neo-Durkheimian theory of rituals and social order, I propose
   that locally based cults of the saints that included public veneration
   lowered the odds that Protestantism would displace Catholicism in
   sixteenth-century German cities. To evaluate this proposition, I first
   turn to historical and theoretical reflection on the role of the cult of
   the saints in late medieval history. I then test the hypothesis with a
   data set of sixteenth-century German cities. Statistical analysis
   provides additional support for the ritual and social order thesis
   because even when several important variables identified by materialist
   accounts of the Reformation in the social scientific literature the
   presence of shrines as an indicator for the cult of the saints remains
   large and significant. Although large-scale social change is usually
   assumed to have politico-economic sources, this analysis suggests that
   cultural factors may be of equal or greater importance.

AB Dominant approaches to the study of gentrification tend to attribute
   this process either to the production of urban space by elites or to the
   consumption of urban space by individual consumers. In this article, we
   take a preliminary step toward bridging this gap by illustrating how
   these groups may, in some cases, be the same actors. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with middle-class parents in Boston, we explore the
   transitions that gentrifiers undergo as they age and have children. As
   young singles and childless couples, our respondents interacted with the
   city mainly as passive consumers. Years later, however, facing pressures
   to relocate in search of high-quality educational options, these parents
   emerged as active producers of the urban landscape through their
   substantial involvement in their children's public elementary schools.
   This school-based engagement reinforced their loyalties to their
   neighborhoods, dissuading them from moving to the suburbs. Since it is
   based on intense interactions with small local institutions, though,
   this strategy will likely be more difficult for parents to sustain in
   larger, less personal high schools. Thus, these parents may reconsider
   their dedication to city living as their children age. We discuss the
   implications of this research for urban theory and policy.

AB Apology is an increasingly prominent form of conflict management in many
   areas of social life. Yet there are few systematic studies of apology as
   a dependent variable. Analyzing the last statements of Texas death row
   prisoners, we find that the best predictor of apology is affiliation
   with God. Under traditional Western conceptions, God is an actor endowed
   with extraordinarily high status. Drawing on the theoretical paradigm
   known as pure sociology, we argue that death row prisoners who invoke
   God as a third party in their conflict thereby elevate their own status.
   Greater vertical closeness to the victim's side generates more social
   assertiveness and a greater willingness to apologize publicly. In
   addition, affiliation increases prisoners' relational closeness to God,
   enhancing their probability of adopting God's modern message of
   reconciliation. God's status has, however, declined somewhat over the
   past several centuriesa trend that helps to explain the modern religious
   emphasis on reconciliation over punishment, apology over defiance.

AB While W. E. B. Du Bois is widely recognized for his contributions to the
   sociology of race, his contributions to the foundations of sociology are
   largely ignored. His sociology is based on African American reformism, a
   version of pragmatism, and a contingent historicism. The basic view of
   sociology is one that emphasizes the role of chance and will as opposed
   to law and certainty. He called sociology "the science of free will."
   His view of society is one that focuses on the historical contingency of
   the structure of society, the malleability of society, and the
   fundamental feature of American society: a society built around the
   "color line" or "veil." This view of society is not merely an
   interesting historical anomaly, but has significant implications for the
   understanding of and development of contemporary sociology.

AB College-educated adults are healthier than other people in the United

   education influences health. This article focuses on the possibility
   that the health benefits of college may vary according to childhood
   (mis)fortune and people's propensity to attain a college degree in the
   first place. Several perspectives from life course sociology offer
   competing hypotheses as to whether the most or the least advantaged see
   the greatest return of a college education. The authors use a national
   survey of middle-age American adults to assess risk of two
   cardiovascular health problems and mortality. Results from propensity
   score and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that the protective
   effect of college attainment is indeed heterogeneous. Further, the
   greatest returns are among those least likely to experience this life
   course transition (i.e., compensatory leveling). Explanations for this
   selection effect are offered, along with several directions for future
   research on the health benefits of completing college.

AB This paper builds on the general connection between culture consumption
   and sociability which has been the focus of recent research in the
   sociology of culture. I propose that cultural variety, as given by the
   number of cultural activities that the person engages in, is tied not
   only to static properties of social networks (such as range), but also
   to the likelihood of having benefited from this connectivity (social
   capital). Taking the classic example of finding a job via a network
   contact as the main outcome, I show that persons who have a propensity
   to engage in a wide variety of cultural activities have a higher
   likelihood of having found out about their current job via a weak tie
   and that different types of weak tie activation are selectively
   correlated with distinct cultural taste profiles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The authors assess the extent to which national-level integration in the
   world polity influences individual-level concern for the environment.
   While theoretically-derived propositions about such relationships have a
   deep history in comparative sociology, they-with few exceptions-remain
   untested. Consistent with past research, employed national-level
   measures of world polity integration include the relative presence of
   environmental international nongovernmental organizations (EINGOs) and
   the existence of environmental ministries. Results of multilevel
   analyses of individual-level environmental concern in 37 nations
   indicate that both forms of world polity integration increase the
   likelihood of individual-level environmental concern, net of other
   national-level factors and individual-level characteristics; although we
   find stronger support for the influence of EINGOs as a key variable
   indicating world polity connection. The findings provide unique support
   for world polity theory, suggesting that future research should consider
   how elements of world polity integration influence other forms of
   individual attitudes and behaviors. The results also highlight the
   importance in considering global and transnational factors when
   assessing the determinants of individual attitudes about the

AB This analysis tests overlooked sociological hypotheses about women's

   Stereotypes about women suggest that shifts in social conditions affect
   these political outcomes by making such stereotypes more or less
   salient. Findings indicate that beliefs about female competencies-such
   as women's purported unwillingness to endorse violent solutions-should
   reduce support for female candidates when increases in violent crime
   create demands for increasingly severe punishments. Since women also are
   typecast as being more protective of vulnerable populations than males,
   states with larger minority populations should have additional women in
   both legislatures. Pooled time-series models based on 1127 state-years
   show that fewer women were present in the state legislatures or in state
   delegations to the House after increases in the murder rates. States
   with larger minority populations, however, had more women in these two

AB Evidence shows that parental financial investments increase college
   attendance, but we know little about how these investments shape
   postsecondary achievement. Two theoretical frameworks suggest diametric
   conclusions. Some studies operate from a more-is-more perspective in
   which children use calculated parental allocations to make academic
   progress. In contrast, a more-is-less perspective, rooted in a different
   model of rational behavior, suggests that parental investments create a
   disincentive for student achievement. I adjudicate between these
   frameworks, using data from nationally representative postsecondary
   datasets to determine what effect financial parental investments have on
   student GPA and degree completion. The findings suggest seemingly
   contradictory processes. Parental aid decreases student GPA, but it
   increases the odds of graduating-net of explanatory variables and
   accounting for alternative funding. Rather than strategically using
   resources in accordance with parental goals, or maximizing on their
   ability to avoid academic work, students are satisficing: they meet the
   criteria for adequacy on multiple fronts, rather than optimizing their
   chances for a particular outcome. As a result, students with parental
   funding often perform well enough to stay in school but dial down their
   academic efforts. I conclude by highlighting the importance of life
   stage and institutional context for parental investment.

   mechanisms and regimes to show how Tilly's understanding of actors,

AB Sociology frequently presumes interest-oriented action but deconstructs
   interests. Here, we argue for more inquiry into the social conditions
   under which interest-oriented action is generated. We analyze how
   interest-oriented action is understood in classical sociology, rational
   choice theory, social exchange theory, and cultural sociology. These
   perspectives vary in the extent to which interests are an explanatory
   principle, how interests are considered, and how emergent social
   formations are explained. However, they share an implicit recognition
   that the question of when interest-oriented action emerges needs more
   attention. Rather than naturalizing interest-oriented action, or
   investigating how interests are constructed, the most productive
   direction for future sociological research on interests is to specify
   better when action oriented to interests becomes normative.

AB This article reviews and evaluates recent comparative social science
   scholarship on healthcare systems. We focus on four of the strongest
   themes in current research: (a) the development of typologies of
   healthcare systems, (b) assessment of convergence among healthcare
   systems, (c) problematization of the shifting boundaries of healthcare
   systems, and (d) the relationship between healthcare systems and social
   inequalities. Our discussion seeks to highlight the central debates that
   animate current scholarship and identify unresolved questions and new
   opportunities for research. We also identify five currents in
   contemporary sociology that have not been incorporated as deeply as they
   might into research on healthcare systems. These five missed turns
   include emphases on social relations, culture, postnational theory,
   institutions, and causal mechanisms. We conclude by highlighting some
   key challenges for comparative research on healthcare systems.

AB Scholarly work on the nexus of religion, nationalism, and violence is
   currently fragmented along disciplinary and theoretical lines. In
   sociology, history, and anthropology, a macro-culturalist approach
   reigns; in political science, economics, and international relations, a
   micro-rationalist approach is dominant. Recent attempts at a synthesis
   ignore religion or fold it into ethnicity. A coherent synthesis capable
   of adequately accounting for religious-nationalist violence must not
   only integrate micro and macro, cultural and strategic approaches; it
   must also include a meso level of elite conflict and boundary
   maintenance and treat the religious field as potentially autonomous from
   the cultural field.

   integration in congregations since the 1940s, only recently has there
   been a concerted focus on this topic. This article-having reviewed the

   three vital labors: explore more theory building or theory extension,
   interact with the broader field of sociology, and explicate how
   religious racial diversity contributes to or dismantles systems of

AB Environmental sociology has become a mature field within the discipline
   of sociology. We consider several of the key theories that define the
   core and boundaries of the field, calling attention to debates and
   unresolved questions. We contend that two of the defining features of
   this field are (a) attention to the inseparability of human and nonhuman
   natures and (b) attention to the role that power and social inequality
   play in shaping human/nonhuman interactions. These two characteristics
   of environmental sociology also reveal strong links between this field
   and the broader discipline, in light of recent reexaminations of
   classical sociological writings. We conclude with a consideration of new
   directions environmental sociologists might take toward building an even
   more robust, interdisciplinary, and critical area of study.

AB Epigenetics is a burgeoning area of biomedical research into the
   mechanisms by which genes are regulated-how the activity of producing
   proteins is controlled. Although molecular epigenetic research is highly
   biochemical, it is of interest to sociologists because some epigenetic
   changes are environmentally mediated and can persist across the life
   span or into further generations. Environmental epigenetic research
   tracks mechanisms by which social forces-from pollution to nutrition to
   mothering to traumatic experience-become molecularly embodied, affect
   gene expression, and induce durable changes in behavior and health. We
   begin with an introduction to the science of environmental epigenetics
   focused on articulating the logic of experimentation and explanation in
   this field. Turning to sociologists' key interests, we review the
   growing literature on epigenetics of socioeconomic status. Finally, we
   consider how epigenetics offers opportunities and challenges for
   sociological research on both empirical and theoretical grounds.

AB This review surveys the sociological work on race and sport over the
   past 50 years. It begins by outlining the importance of C.L.R. James's
   book Beyond a Boundary as a foundational text for the critical sociology
   of race and sport. Two paradigms of research on race and sport are
   sketched: the critical and the functionalist-evolutionary. The article
   then reviews the major contributions to the study of race and sport from
   three areas, namely mainstream American sociology, the sociology of
   race, and the sociology of sport, focusing primarily on the research
   published since 2000. The article concludes by looking at future
   directions of work in the field, suggesting that although sport remains
   marginal to mainstream American sociology and the insights of scholars
   such as James remain overlooked, the best work on race and sport will
   continue to emerge from the subfield of sport studies.

AB The study of housing has a long history in sociology, but since the
   1960s, it has been relatively hidden in a number of sociological
   subfields and scattered across a range of disciplines. The financial
   crisis of 2008 elevated housing issues to the level of national and
   international debate and protest, and it offers a framework for
   organizing the scholarship on housing into that which studies housing as
   a commodity, on one hand, and as a right, on the other. In the former
   category, I review the literature on mortgage financing; property values
   and wealth; and affordable rental housing, foreclosures, and evictions.
   In the latter category, I discuss the theoretical arguments for a right
   to housing and review the research on activist demands for that right.
   The tension between these two aspects of housing is discussed
   throughout. I conclude by proposing the actual home or apartment as a
   productive area for new sociological analysis.

AB This article endeavors to replace the sociology of professions with the
   more comprehensive and timely sociology of expertise. It suggests that
   we need to distinguish between experts and expertise as requiring two
   distinct modes of analysis that are not reducible to one another. It
   analyzes expertise as a network linking together agents, devices,
   concepts, and institutional and spatial arrangements. It also suggests
   rethinking how abstraction and power were analyzed in the sociology of
   professions. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to
   explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses. This article
   shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the
   deinstitutionalization of mental retardation created a new institutional
   matrix within which a new set of actors-the parents of children with
   autism in alliance with psychologists and therapists-were able to forge
   an alternative network of expertise.

AB This article presents a theoretical approach for studying the
   coordination of futures. Building off theories of temporality and
   action, the authors map three different modes of future
   making-protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes-that actors
   need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a
   wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of
   future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although
   they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in
   interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those
   three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a
   methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms
   through which other theoretical or empirical constructs-such as racism
   or late modernity-operate; and open a window into the ways in which
   people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its
   own right.

AB Postcolonial theory has enjoyed wide influence in the humanities but it
   has left sociology comparatively unscathed. Does this mean that
   postcolonial theory is not relevant to sociology? Focusing upon social
   theory and historical sociology in particular, this article considers if
   and how postcolonial theory in the humanities might be imported into
   North American sociology. It argues that postcolonial theory offers a
   substantial critique of sociology because it alerts us to sociology's
   tendency to analytically bifurcate social relations. The article also
   suggests that a postcolonial sociology can overcome these problems by
   incorporating relational social theories to give new accounts of
   modernity. Rather than simply studying non-Western postcolonial
   societies or only examining colonialism, this approach insists upon the
   interactional constitution of social units, processes, and practices
   across space. To illustrate, the article draws upon relational theories
   (actor-network theory and field theory) to offer postcolonial accounts
   of two conventional research areas in historical sociology: the
   industrial revolution in England and the French Revolution.

AB The scholarly literature on teaching sociology contains relatively
   little about improving courses from one semester to the next. In this
   article, I describe a method for continual teaching improvement that is
   based on writing, the well-established practice of teacher reflection,
   and classical sociological principles. This method was developed through
   the analysis of nine semesters of autoethnographic data that I collected
   in the form of daily reflective notes. The benefits of this
   sociologically informed reflective practice include grounding
   evaluations of individual class periods and entire courses in empirical
   data, becoming more efficient with course preparation, providing one
   with a stronger sense of mastery as a teacher, and developing as a
   sociologist by using the classroom as a key site for engaging in praxis.
   This practice can help teachers refine individual courses, improve as an
   instructor in an overall sense and more deeply connect sociology to the
   scholarship of teaching and learning.

AB Sociologists and scholars of composition have long argued that in order
   to get students to improve the quality of what they write, they need to
   change how they write. Here, the authors assess whether students'
   participation in writing-intensive first-year seminars leads to changes
   in their writing process. Data collected via pretest and posttest
   interviews of 34 students show that writing-intensive seminars help
   first-year students become better planners and revisers yet have little
   effect on the ways that they prewrite and draft. Additionally, students
   in their first semester of college demonstrate higher order writing
   processes at the beginning of their seminar than their second-semester
   counterparts and show more improvement over the course of the semester
   as well. We analyze the conditions that foster these patterns and
   suggest that increasing quantitative course requirements (i.e., page
   counts) may hamper students' ability to adopt qualitatively better
   writing strategies.

AB In this article, we examine common practices and attitudes surrounding
   writing pedagogy in the sociology classroom based on an analysis of
   interviews with 19 sociologists at seven institutions in the Northeast.
   Our discussion is centered on two distinct approaches to writing that
   faculty identified: writing as cognitive development and writing as
   skill development. We observe that when they teach writing, sociologists
   shift their attention back and forth between these two essential
   features of good writing. Our analysis contextualizes writing as a form
   of distributed cognition (Salomon 1993), because it is taught and
   learned across multiple experiences in the academy. In conclusion, we
   suggest that a greater attentiveness to the underlying cognitive
   features of writing will broaden opportunities for campus-wide dialogue
   about writing across the disciplines and enhance our students' ability
   to transfer and build upon their writing experiences across courses.

   transactional writing is used in courses stating critical thinking and

AB Both "theory" and "writing" engender a great deal of anxiety for the
   typical undergraduate sociology major. Writing-intensive theory courses
   increase this feeling exponentially. Active learning approaches to
   teaching theory are often advocated as a way to combat these fears, but
   few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce
   student anxiety. This article describes and evaluates the Film Analysis
   Papers writing assignment designed to reduce student anxiety in an
   undergraduate theory course. I present data from a questionnaire that
   asked students to assess the effect of writing about film on theory
   anxiety. Findings show that the film assignment reduced anxiety about
   writing theoretically and improved student confidence in their ability
   to theorize. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of
   active learning approaches on theory anxiety in order to understand
   whether anxiety mediates the relationship between active learning and
   learning outcomes in theory classes.

AB This article contributes to an ongoing theoretical effort to extend the
   insights of relational and network sociology into adjacent domains. We
   integrate Simmel's late theory of the relational self into the formal
   analysis of social relations, generating a framework for theorizing
   forms of association among self-relating individuals. On this model,
   every "node" in an interaction has relations not only to others but also
   to itself, specifically between its ideality and its actuality. We go on
   to integrate this self-relation into a formal model of social relations.
   This model provides a way to describe configurations of social
   interactions defined by the forms according to which social relations
   realize participants' ideal selves. We examine four formal dimensions
   along which these self-relational relationships can vary: distance,
   symmetry, scope, and actualization.

AB Sociologists have argued that markets are politically constituted, yet

   this article I show how the concept of cultural framing-already widely
   used by economic sociologists-can be further developed to explain how
   mobilization reproduces markets in some moments while reorganizing them
   in others. Specifically, I link the concept of cultural framing to
   rent-seeking mobilization within markets to better explain when
   political contestation will lead to new market institutions and when it
   will fail to do so. I illustrate the value of this approach through an
   analysis of deregulation in the U. S. airline industry and conclude by
   discussing the consequences of the model and empirical case for the
   politics of markets, the rise of neoliberalism, and economic
   policymaking.

AB Weber argued that human suffering creates the demand for theodicies:
   cultural vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain perceived
   injustices. This article combines an interpretive analysis of rhetoric
   commemorating the events of September 11, 2001 with an effort to
   construct generalizable cultural theory, demonstrating how the Weberian
   concept of theodicy adds to our understanding of commemorative rhetoric.
   In the case of September 11 commemorations, the theodicies deployed
   exhibit a clear fracture. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville,
   Pennsylvania, have taken a dualistic approach to the problem of
   theodicy, while speakers in Manhattan have taken a tragic approach. This
   variation can be explained through a four-part model that argues
   theodicies are structured by (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3)
   audiences, and (4) genre memory. More broadly, I argue for explicit
   attention to theodicy in cultural sociology, demonstrating that the
   quest for theodicy is a crucial driving force behind the impulse to
   commemorate in the first place.

AB Urban sociology has tended to study interactions between passersby and
   street persons with an emphasis on the ways street persons become
   bothersome, harassing, or dangerous. This article moves away from the
   focus on the ways interactions in public go awry and focuses on how
   individuals account for the mundane, everyday exchanges they have with
   strangers who seek their help. Based on interview data (N = 31) and
   qualitative analysis of data from an Internet survey (N = 110), this
   article suggests that the presence of beggars does not inherently
   symbolize urban decay to passersby and does not necessarily elicit
   anxiety, but instead provides a valuable texture of urban life. Further,
   the article argues that individuals, when justifying their responses to
   requests for help from needy persons (beggars) in urban spaces, use a
   variety of cultural strategies to maintain their perception of
   themselves as moral persons, both when they choose to help and when they
   refuse. Drawing from these findings, the article suggests that urban
   sociology and the sociology of risk would benefit from sensitizing their
   studies of public interactions to the diverse meanings individuals

AB Democratic theorists and social scientists suggest that a deliberative
   public sphere would be good for democracy by maximizing emancipatory
   possibilities and providing broad legitimacy to political decision
   making. But do ordinary Americans actually want a deliberative public
   sphere? I examine this question in the context of four contentious
   religion and science debates. Through a multidimensional evaluation
   exercise with 62 ordinary respondents, I find that evaluation of public
   representatives in these debates tends to favor open-mindedness and
   ongoing debate. Further, respondents explicitly discount elected
   representatives who participate in public debate precisely because they
   are seen as violating deliberative norms through their affiliation with
   electoral politics. Respondents want a deliberative public sphere.
   However, this desire reflects an understanding of the public sphere and
   institutional politics as disconnected arenas with incompatible rules
   and objectives, raising multiple questions for democratic theory and for
   political sociology.

AB Much research has concluded that human rights treaties have a null or
   negative effect on governments human rights practices. This article
   reexamines the influence of human rights treaties, with a focus on two
   kinds of treaty effects: directthe effect of treaties on the countries
   that ratified them; and diffusethe effect of treaties on countries
   regardless of ratification. My analysis of two prominent human rights
   treaties finds that they often reduce levels of repression and abuse
   over time and independently of ratification. Some of these effects are
   nonlinear, reversing direction as time elapses or as more countries
   become party to the treaties. These findings are interpreted with
   reference to world polity institutionalism in sociology, and especially
   the Durkheimian strains of this approach. Human rights norms as embodied
   in treaties operate as a kind of civil religion for world society. These
   norms not only have long-term direct effects among countries that
   ritualistically ratify human rights treaties, but they also diffusely
   impact countries irrespective of formal endorsement.

AB This article sets out to explain why after the 1978 assassination of San
   Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk, it is
   the latter who has achieved world recognition. At the time of their
   assassination Moscone was the more well-known figure, an American
   politician with a national reputation. The theories of social drama and
   cultural trauma are applied in this explanatory process. These theories
   provide a framework for analyzing how this incident became a significant
   event locally and nationally. The fact that Milk was one of the first
   openly gay people to hold public office in the United States meant that
   his life and death would have significance for a wide group of people.
   Individuals and organizations associated with gay liberation became
   carrier groups which created the Harvey Milk story and how it was told.
   Such carrier groups saw to it that Milk was remembered, and remembered
   in a particular way.

   analyst combines preexisting generalizations with specific observations
   from within a single case to make causal inferences about that case.
   Process tracing tests can be used to help establish that (1) an initial
   event or process took place, (2) a subsequent outcome also occurred, and
   (3) the former was a cause of the latter. The article focuses on the
   logic of different process tracing tests, including hoop tests, smoking
   gun tests, and straw in the wind tests. New criteria for judging the
   strength of these tests are developed using ideas concerning the
   relative importance of necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarities
   and differences between process tracing and the deductive-nomological

AB This article approaches work talk, a neglected but vital object of
   sociological inquiry, as a possible key to unlocking the mystery of the
   contemporary work ethic as it appears among male professionals living
   and working in the United States and Western Europe. This analytical
   task is carried out through a close examination of the contrasting
   rhetorics, scripts, and vocabularies anchoring French, Norwegian, and
   American forms of hard work talk. This comparative exercise capitalizes
   on material from over one hundred in-depth interviews with comparable
   French, Norwegian, and American male business professionals working in
   finance, law, consulting, engineering and other professional fields.
   Scrutinizing the scripts that members of these three groups use to
   address their motives for working hard in demanding jobs, this article
   maps a legitimation divide between the American respondents and their
   French and Norwegian counterparts. The hard work commentaries of the
   French and Norwegian respondents feature script repertoires that focus
   exclusively on the stimulating and enriching character of their work
   activities. By contrast, the commentaries of the American respondents
   incorporate overachievement scripts addressing both the extrinsic
   rewards of work and the personality traits that make hard work a natural
   expression of personality. These hard work commentaries invoke career
   success and moneymaking as inducements to hard work. But they also
   invoke personality traits such as drive and the innate aversion to
   leisure. This transatlantic divide reflects the greater cultural
   resonance of self-realization in the two European contexts and the fact
   that the French and Norwegians have embraced a more Maslowian approach
   to working life. As I argue in the article's conclusion, these
   transatlantic differences in script repertoires can be viewed as the
   product of the societally specific cultural configurations at work in
   the three countries. Such cultural configurations define what it
   means-in terms of status and authenticity-to work hard in a remunerative
   and rewarding job.

   typically think that it is developed for our students, there appears to
   be a considerable gap between how our curriculum, especially
   Introductory Sociology is organized, and what we know about current
   college students. Drawing on data on enrollment in sociology and overall
   in colleges and universities along with recent scholarly portraits of
   college students by Nathan (2005), Clydesdale (2007), and Arum and Roska
   (2011), I offer the following argument: (1) Our "students" are primarily
   those who take Introductory Sociology, and this class, indeed, is our
   public face for most nonacademics; (2) given where U.S. college students
   matriculate, all too often, Introductory Sociology is likely being
   taught by someone not as well connected as we might like to our main
   professional organization; (3) comprehensive textbooks dominate the
   Introductory Sociology market and contain more information that can
   reasonably be covered in one semester; (4) college students are
   "practical credentialists" who spend relatively little time outside of
   the classroom on their studies; and (5) whether or not we as
   sociologists agree on what needs to be covered in Introductory Sociology
   and other courses, we have derived these understandings among ourselves,
   paying little attention to what skills and knowledge our students want
   and/or need. If Introductory Sociology really is our public face, we
   clearly need to spend a considerable amount of time in making sure that
   this is how we want to be seen.

   is used to evaluate the effect of the different course settings,

   indicate that differences in student performance between the two

   that student satisfaction does not significantly differ across the two

   how their own consumption habits are shaped by larger social forces and
   how they, along with most Americans, tend toward overconsumption. To a
   more limited extent, it may help enhance cognitive understanding of

   Drawn from a national sample of adoptive households (n = 63,681), the

   Although white adoptive parents, in general, are more likely to
   transracially adopt Hispanic and Asian children, white single and

   interpret three ecologiessuccessive periods of urban metabolism research
   spanning three disciplines within the social sciences. The first is the
   human ecology of the Chicago School, which treated the city as an
   ecosystem in analogy to external, natural ecosystems. The second is
   industrial ecology: materials-flow analyses of cities that conceptualize
   external nature as the source of urban metabolism's raw materials and
   the destination for its social wastes. The third is urban political
   ecology, a reconceptualization of the city as a product of diverse
   socio-natural flows. By analyzing these three traditions in succession,
   I demonstrate both the efficacy and the limits to Catton and Dunlap's
   distinction between a human exemptionalist paradigm and a new ecological
   paradigm in sociology.

AB U.S. immigration has changed dramatically in the last 20 years:
   immigrants have increasingly gravitated toward new destinations and a
   growing portion are undocumented. In the absence of federal
   comprehensive immigration reform, states are proposing a patchwork of
   laws. While some laws encourage immigrant integration, most seek
   restriction. To understand this trend, this article analyzes Utah as a
   new immigration destination, exploring its transformation from an
   inclusive to a restrictive state. It focuses on a major debate: whether
   to allow unauthorized residents legal driving privileges. Because Utah
   initiated this law earlier than most, it leads this debate. To explain
   its evolution, this article analyzes 10 years of legislative debates and
   articles published on this law. Building on the narrative studies
   literature, I find that both sides of the immigration debate utilized a
   public safety and well-being narrative. However, supporters of the
   driver license law relied on a lower mimetic narrative, characterized by
   logic and factual arguments. In contrast, their opponents wove a
   compelling, apocalyptic narrative to criticize the law. This narrative
   indelibly linked immigration to the dangers of crime and terrorism and
   thus paved the way for the passage of one of the most restrictive
   immigration laws in the United States.

AB Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are
   analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and
   interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine
   together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues
   relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1)
   social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend
   socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins
   interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of
   religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively
   substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms
   play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization
   plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious
   outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications
   for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious
   homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as
   limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed. (c)

AB This article explores the phenomenological and socially constructed
   experience of time during the finite period of the vacation. Temporal
   routine is considered as a form of social control from which vacations
   and similar breaks for time off offer opportunities for agency and
   release. In-depth interviews, participant observation, and a narrative
   analysis of vacation blogs are used to analyze norms in orientation to
   time while one is away from select constraints of everyday life.
   Approaches to time while on vacation are found to fall into two ideal
   types: those who may "ignore" time and find release from schedules and
   routine, and those who must closely attend to its passage. Influences of
   duration, frequency and pace are also central in moderating experience.

AB This is a qualitative study detailing the links between racial discourse
   and social action. Specifically, this article provides evidence for the
   ways in which a white habitus is reproduced in a racially diverse
   community, despite the best intentions of its community members. This is
   chiefly due to the influence of national color-blind ideologies and the
   diversity discourse that follows. Because this ideology and discourse
   are individual in nature and centered on a white norm, it chiefly
   produces consumption-driven actions for individuals and collective
   action that protects those with racial privilege. While prior studies
   have detailed the influence of this ideology on racial attitudes and
   examined the contours of diversity discourse generally, this study
   utilizes the racial formations approach to make concrete links to social
   outcomes in a diverse community. These findings are particularly
   significant given the hope vested in racially diverse communities as the
   nation itself becomes more diverse.

AB We explore how white activists' racial identity struggles might disrupt
   effective antiracist action in multiracial organizations. Drawing on
   data collected through participant observation and interviews, we
   examine the struggles of a small, multiracial antiracist organization
   that protests the Cleveland baseball franchise's 'Indians' name and
   Chief Wahoo mascot. White activists' racial consciousness, or awareness
   of white racism and white privilege, compels them to participate in the
   group; their ways of participating, however, ultimately may hamper the
   organizational effectiveness of the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity
   and Resistance. Specifically, white activists' racial consciousness
   makes them reluctant to adopt necessary leadership roles. Borrowing from
   literature on white racism, white racial consciousness, and multiracial
   organizing, we illustrate the complex nature and potential pitfalls of
   multiracial alliances formed to protest racism in the United States.

AB In the heated debate regarding 'illegal immigration' in the US,
   arguments and accusations have abounded regarding economics,
   citizenship, criminality, and culture, but race has remained
   conspicuously sidelined in public discussion. I argue that race is in
   fact central to the debate on immigration, both by those opposed to any
   legalization of undocumented workers in the US and those who favor a
   temporary worker ('work visa') program. In this article, I examine how
   both anti-immigration and pro-work-visa groups framed the immigration
   debate as reported in newspaper articles in the particularly contentious
   period from December 2005 to November 2006. I performed a content
   analysis of three newspapers representing three different regions and
   three differing histories of immigration: the Chicago Tribune, the
   Houston Chronicle, and the Raleigh News & Observer. Using Blumer's group
   position theory, I examine the patterns within the discussion for
   evidence of preservation of racial group position on the part of both
   anti-immigration and pro-work visa advocates.

   this condition, this article has two interrelated goals: first, to raise
   the importance of Bourdieu's 'cultural intermediary' and the practice of
   spatial narratives as concerns for the study of culture, and, second, to
   refit Wendy Griswold's (1987a) 1987 framework for a sociology of culture

AB Social scientists have intensely debated the use of deception in
   experimental research, and conflicting norms governing the use of
   deception are now firmly entrenched along disciplinary lines. Deception
   is typically allowed in sociology and social psychology but proscribed
   in economics. Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are
   generally not based on ethical considerations but on pragmatic grounds:
   the anti-deception camp argues that deceiving participants leads to
   invalid results, while the other side argues that deception has little
   negative impact and, under certain conditions, can even enhance
   validity. These divergent norms governing the use of deception are
   important because they stifle interdisciplinary research and discovery,
   create hostilities between disciplines and researchers, and can
   negatively impact the careers of scientists who may be sanctioned for
   following the norms of their home discipline. We present two
   experimental studies aimed at addressing the issue empirically. Study 1
   addresses the effects of direct exposure to deception, while Study 2
   addresses the effects of indirect exposure to deception. Results from
   both studies suggest that deception does not significantly affect the
   validity of experimental results.

AB Past research in both the transitions to adulthood literature and
   cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies
   on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the
   contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways
   are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93
   interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s
   to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional
   markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models
   do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities?
   In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that
   respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an
   inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I
   demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and
   women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful
   family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their
   performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left
   many lost in transition.

   states, human rights language is, first, especially common in countries
   most susceptible to global influences. Second, human rights language is
   driven by the extent of the international human rights regime at the
   time of a constitution's writing. Third, human rights language tends to
   appear in newer constitutions and in the constitutions of emergent and
   reorganized states. National constitutions are imprinted with global

AB Despite the prominence of teaching in academia, we know little about how
   graduate students learn to teach. We propose the concept of a teaching
   community network (TCN), an informal social network that facilitates the
   exchange of teaching-specific resources. We explore the role of TCNs
   through a case study of a sociology doctoral program at a large state
   university. Results reveal that students rely heavily on informal ties
   within the graduate student community and existing formal programs to
   share teaching-related resources (e.g., information and social support)
   and develop their identities as instructors. We suggest that graduate
   programs facilitate TCNs through formal teacher-training programs and
   structural conditions that encourage informal, one-on-one interactions
   (e.g., shared offices). By cultivating TCNs, graduate programs can
   assist students in developing their teaching skills and identities as
   instructors, thus training students to balance the demands of research
   and teaching within an academic culture.

   program to institutionalize the practice of method triangulation, and

   community partners when engaging in community-based learning. Often when
   faculty incorporate service- or community-based learning into their
   classes, we measure the "learning" part but not the "service" or
   "community." Focusing more on the latter involves working "with"
   community partners instead of working "for" community partners, and this
   focus creates a more effective experience for all stakeholders involved.
   Achieving this goal of working "with" partners not only requires
   collaboration but also requires an effort to create and develop a sense
   of agency among the community partners. In the current teaching note,
   collaborative projects between undergraduate sociology classes and a
   local senior center are discussed. These projects show enhanced learning
   for the college students as well as an enhanced experience for community
   partners due to the emphasis on establishing and nurturing agency among

AB This article develops the concept of experiential careers, drawing
   theoretical attention to the routinization and de-routinization of
   specific experiences as they unfold over social career trajectories.
   Based on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in two religious
   communities, we compare the social-temporal patterning of religious
   experience among newly religious Orthodox Jews and converted Muslims in
   two cities in the United States. In both cases, we find that as newly
   religious people work to transform their previous bodily habits and take
   on newly prescribed religious acts, the beginning of their religious
   careers becomes marked by what practitioners describe as potent
   religious experiences in situations of religious practice. However, over
   time, these once novel practices become routinized and religious
   experiences in these situations diminish, thus provoking actors and
   institutions in both fields to work to re-enchant religious life.
   Through this ethnographic comparison, we demonstrate the utility of
   focusing on experiential careers as a sociological unit of analysis.
   Doing so allows sociologists to use a non-reductive phenomenological
   approach to chart the shifting manifestations of experiences people
   deeply care about, along with the patterned enchantments,
   disenchantments, and possible re-enchantments these social careers
   entail. As such, this approach contributes to the analysis of social
   careers and experiences of "becoming" across both religious and
   non-religious domains.

   conscious action has often been viewed at the level of the individual
   actor and, moreover, in overly "cognitive" and "rational" terms. As a
   result, the very reading of classic texts has been historically biased
   against the seeing of emotion, even when it is addressed. What

   of the genomic research that has identified the clusters, without
   diminishing the social character of their context, meaning, production,

   constructionist account of race as lacking biological reality, its main
   shortcomings, and our proposed solution: the concept of clinal classes.
   The second part discusses the character of the group differences that
   would be consistent with clinal classes and introduces the concept of
   genomic individualism, which extends an emerging model for understanding
   biosocial causation to include the genetic effects of ancestry. The

AB In contemporary sociology the once prominent study of public opinion has
   virtually disappeared. None of the leading theoretical models in the
   closest disciplinary subfield (political sociology) currently provide
   ample or sufficiently clear space for consideration of public opinion as
   a possible factor in shaping or interacting with key policy or political
   outcomes in democratic polities. In this article, we unearth and
   document the sources of this curious development and raise questions
   about its implications for how political sociologists have come to
   understand policy making, state formation, and political conflict. We
   begin by reconstructing the dismissal of public opinion in the
   intellectual reorientation of political sociology from the late 1970s
   onward. We argue that the most influential scholarly works of this
   period (including those of Tilly, Skocpol, Mann, Esping-Andersen, and
   Domhoff) face an underlying paradox: While often rejecting public
   opinion, their theoretical logics ultimately presuppose its operation.
   These now classical writings did not move toward research programs
   seeking engagement with the operation and formation of public opinion,
   even though our immanent critique suggests they in fact require
   precisely this turn. We address the challenge of reconceptualizing how
   public opinion might be productively integrated into the sociological
   study of politics by demonstrating that the major arguments in the
   subfield can be fruitfully extended by grappling with public opinion. We
   conclude by considering several recent, interdisciplinary examples of
   scholarship that, we argue, point the way toward a fruitful
   revitalization.

   A scene creates an emotive context that demands consistent and timely

AB The debate on civic decline inspired by Putnam's "bowling alone" thesis
   exposed an important limitation in three dominant conceptions of the
   civic. Whether conceptualized as a locus, type, or motivation for
   action, the boundaries distinguishing the civic from other categories of
   political action are permeable and indistinct. This article develops a
   theory of civic production to better account for the inherent
   normativity and "porousness" of this analytic category. I conceptualize
   the civic as a variable, contingent outcome or product of a contentious
   performance undertaken in some venue for some reason. The phenomenon of
   "civic recreation," a form of fund-raising that combines a leisure
   activity with a public cause, underscores the necessity of a theory of
   civic production. I draw from social movement theory and from
   ethnographic data from one fitness fund-raiser to illustrate some of the
   key processes and outcomes for which a theory of civic production must
   account.

   Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income

   the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings
   inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error
   causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion
   is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial
   downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks
   at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial
   group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to
   the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on
   economic inequality estimates.

AB The study of sport spectatorship has an increasing focus on the

   fan behavior are the meaningful rituals and emotions experienced by
   fans. In this paper, I use the theoretical work of Randall Collins to
   examine the ritualistic outcomes of collective effervescence, emotional
   energy, and group symbols and solidarity among sport fans. I illustrate
   these concepts using case study data from participant observation of
   fans of a U.S. football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and content
   analysis of news articles. I extend Collins' interaction ritual (IR)
   theory by taking the group as the unit of analysis and analyzing group
   solidarity beyond situational interactions and typical sport settings,
   including the significant life events of weddings and funerals. While
   critiquing Collins' (2004) a priori portrayal of sports fans, the
   analysis advances IR theory, improving its utility for understanding
   sports fan behavior.

AB Although few disagree that advancements in technology and the
   establishment of trade-conducive transnational institutions play an
   important role in augmenting the potential for trade globalization,
   there is more disagreement surrounding alternative causal explanations
   of trade during the postwar period. While world-system scholars argue
   that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is
   powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive
   policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the
   emanation of cultural scripts that create compatible national
   institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these
   theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945
   to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results
   provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in
   the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade
   globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the
   world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively
   associated with international trade, there is little evidence to
   validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental
   organizations enhances trade globalization.

   less if the coercer is a computer. These hypotheses are extended from

   experiment of coercion in social exchange, adding a human versus

   that replicates Molm et al.s study and supports the hypotheses on

   sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and
   present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism
   appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and
   archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling,
   the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce
   educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort,
   unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be
   interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a
   virtuous identity, claims to be "one who aspires."

   approach to the environment, including its significance for his
   interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For
   Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical
   realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy
   scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways
   within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to

   elaborate upon the ways that neoliberalism and the politics of sex and

   movements previously organized around struggles for economic justice and

   further demonstrate how human rights discourse has become a key vehicle
   both for the transnationalization of carceral politics and for the
   reincorporation of these policies into the domestic terrain in a
   benevolent, feminist guise. I conclude by urging greater and more
   nuanced attention to the operations of gender and sexual politics within
   mainstream analyses of contemporary modes of punishment, as well as a
   careful consideration of the neoliberal carceral state within feminist
   discussions of gender, sexuality, and the law.

AB Military expenditures have escalated over the last three decades in both
   developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding
   expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed
   towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the "new" military. We
   hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no
   longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many
   uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant
   consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such
   consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this
   hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed
   and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that
   military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per
   soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither
   total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a
   significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's "new"
   military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an
   equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. (C)

AB This article describes and evaluates an activity designed to demonstrate
   how biological factors (e.g., genetics), individual-level behaviors
   (e.g., smoking), and social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) shape
   health status and access to health care. Active learning techniques were
   utilized to introduce the sociological imagination as it pertains to
   health, as well as to physically demonstrate stratification processes. A
   pretest-posttest design was implemented to evaluate the activity's
   impact on student learning outcomes (N = 305). Analysis suggests that
   after the activity students regarded society as important for
   influencing health, including a shift in responsibility for one's health
   away from the individual, and that students gained a greater
   understanding of the importance of social class in shaping health. In
   open-ended responses, students indicated that the physicality of the
   approach provided further clarity of abstract concepts. Implications of
   these findings and broader directions for advancing students'
   understanding of disparities related to health are discussed.

   a one-semester, required sociology research capstone course. The data
   come from 106 students in eight sections of the course taught at three
   institutions. We used multiple methods for data collection:
   questionnaires, focus groups, and learning reflection essays. Our
   results include students' having a good sense of what to expect from the
   course, reporting learning many research-related skills, and having more
   positive attitudes about the course in the postmeasures than in the
   premeasures. Students also stated that the highly structured nature of
   the course was important for their success but somewhat frustrating.
   Other important student perceptions were that the course was demanding
   and time consuming; past courses helped prepare for the capstone
   experience but that there are gaps in this preparation; they learn best
   via active learning, feedback, and application; they are proud of their
   course achievements; and they are engaged in the discipline but are
   ambiguous about future work in sociology.

AB Sociology majors learn that sociological theory is foundational to our
   field; it frames the way we look at the world and provides guiding
   questions for our social inquiry. But sociology instructors know that
   teaching theory is a challenge. A number of activities have been created
   to engage students in sociological theory courses. This note discusses
   an exercise that adds to these activities and is tied to the learning
   outcomes of a theory course. The author's students are given a
   challenge: For 72 hours back-to-back, avoid checking or communicating
   via Facebook or MySpace; making calls from cell phones, unless it is an
   emergency; and texting or e-mailing from cell phones and handheld
   devices. The author found that this Technology Fast Challenge helped
   students foster a sociological perspective and allowed them to engage
   the ideas and questions of major social theorists. The author discusses
   the format of the challenge, the outcomes, and applications to other
   courses.

AB Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course
   trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel
   data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents'
   attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured
   or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from
   cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other
   fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a
   rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel
   conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in
   prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among
   adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey
   questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were
   considerably less likely than members of a control group to report
   substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has
   important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to
   be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological
   issue.

   Makers: Turning Theory Into Action," the presidential address reported
   research findings (scientific sociology) that were accompanied by a
   documentary that represented the research results (applied sociology).
   Guided by a social constructionist perspective, findings from five
   studies were organized into seven themes to demonstrate the problems
   domestic violence victims, or protective parents, encounter when their
   abusers entangle them in contested custody battles. The documentary
   shown in the presidential address can be viewed in this article by
   connecting to a link provided. It is noted that the focus of the
   research and documentary remain at the social issue level-a phenomenon
   that exists in society, but has not yet been defined as a social
   problem. It is argued that the problems identified in the research are
   affecting many thousands of domestic violence victims and their
   children, yet the issue has received minimal attention in the discipline
   of sociology.

AB What is the relationship between state-level politics and the resources
   devoted to children's health insurance programs (CHIP)? The authors
   asses this question by drawing on theories from the power resources,
   institutionalist, logic of industrialism, and racial threat schools of
   thought. The authors find that each approach offers some explanatory
   power for per capita CHIP spending. In particular, Republican strength
   in state legislatures and governorships are associated with diminished
   CHIP spending. Professionalized state legislatures, strong state
   financial capacities, and states with a legacy of social policy
   innovation were linked to greater CHIP spending. States with more
   uninsured children tended to spend more per capita. And states with
   greater numbers of blacks spent less per capita. But there was no
   similar effect for Hispanics. The authors conclude that an array of
   forces at the state level figure prominently in cross-state inequality
   and the prospects for social citizenship.

AB Theorized links between science and secularism are prevalent in classic
   sociological thought. More recently, scholars have critiqued these
   frameworks as oversimplified and empirically untenable. In response to
   such criticisms, contemporary researchers typically overlook or actively
   argue against links between science and secularism. This study analyzes
   data from a random, national survey of adults to examine the empirical
   connections between perceptions of science and secular identities in the
   United States. Analyses demonstrate that perceptions of science
   correlate strongly with American secularism, particularly among atheists
   and agnostics. Additionally, politicized views of science help account
   for the previously documented relationship between political and secular
   identities in the United States. A perspective drawing on the sociology
   of culture and perceived knowledge provides a more useful framework for
   understanding these patterns than theories of secularization.

AB Contemporary social research often has located religion's public
   influence by focusing on individual or collective religious actors. In
   this unitary actor model, religion is a stable, uniform feature of an
   individual or collectivity. However, recent research shows that people's
   religious expression outside religious congregations varies by context.
   Building on this new work, along with insights from Erving Goffman and
   cultural sociology, an alternative, "cultural-interactionist model" of
   religious expression focuses on how group styles enable and constrain
   religious expression in public settings. Illustrating the model are two
   ethnographic cases, a religiously sponsored homeless advocacy
   organization and a secondary comparison setting from an activist
   campaign for housing, both from a U.S. metropolitan area. Shifting from
   actors to settings and group styles clarifies the interplay between
   religious and nonreligious culture over time. The shift refines our
   understanding of how religion's civic or political effects work, as in
   the case of building social capital for collective action. The
   cultural-interactionist model enables us to track historical change in
   everyday group settings. It promotes further research on historically
   changing ways of managing religious diversity, and diverse ways of
   constructing a religious self.

   positively associated with the vertical flow of exports, and the
   relationship is much more pronounced for lower-income countries than for
   high-income countries. Additional findings suggest that the observed
   relationship for lower-income nations has grown in magnitude through

   examining specific analogies, narratives, and metanarratives, I show how
   the comparison of 9/11 to the attacks on Pearl Harbor has led to varying

   across all groups. Green practices are not isolated decisions or
   actions, but components in an ongoing project. As a result, green
   lifestyles are often experienced as both a work in progress and a
   provisionally coherent life narrative. Furthermore, I explore bricolage,
   the cobbling together of resources at hand by nonexperts, as a mechanism
   for lifestyle change and expand the concept to include environmental
   practices and themes. I adopt a pragmatist perspective to understand
   lifestyle change as a deliberate process undertaken in response to a

   Also, these women are constrained by household responsibilities. These

AB In recent work in the sociology of education, the primary effects of
   stratification are defined as the effects of social class origins on
   preparation for future educational attainment. The secondary effects are
   then the net direct effects of social class on the transition to the
   next higher level of education, which are interpreted as average effects
   of class conditions on students' choices. In this article, the standard
   model of primary and secondary effects is laid out in explicit form, and
   primary and secondary effects are then estimated for college entry among
   recent high school graduates in the United States. The challenges of
   estimating these effects for educational transitions in the United
   States are then explained, focusing on the weak warrant for causal
   inference that is used to justify the calculation of counterfactual net
   differences across classes. Alternative estimates of associational
   primary and secondary effects are then offered, after which the
   prospects for the identification of causal secondary effects by
   conditioning on additional confounders are assessed. In conclusion, an
   appeal is made for attention to the policy-relevant patterns of
   heterogeneity that research on primary and secondary effects may be able
   to reveal, and a case is made for elaboration and direct identification
   of the presupposed choice mechanism that has been assumed to generate
   secondary effects in past research.

   empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in
   which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be
   evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of
   individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which
   the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and
   interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations
   of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which
   we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations
   of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were
   formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a
   multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to
   address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural
   reception in a single analytic framework.

AB This article examines why global corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   frameworks have gained popularity in the past decade, despite their
   uncertain costs and benefits, and how they affect adherents' behavior.
   We focus on the two largest global frameworks-the United Nations Global
   Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative-to examine patterns of CSR
   adoption by governments and corporations. Drawing on institutional and
   political-economy theories, we develop a new analytic framework that
   focuses on four key environmental factors-global institutional pressure,
   local receptivity, foreign economic penetration, and national economic
   system. We propose two arguments about the relationship between stated
   commitment and subsequent action: decoupling due to lack of capacity and
   organized hypocrisy due to lack of will. Our cross-national time-series
   analyses show that global institutional pressure through nongovernmental
   linkages encourages CSR adoption, but this pressure leads to ceremonial
   commitment in developed countries and to substantive commitment in
   developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries, liberal economic
   policies increase ceremonial commitment, suggesting a pattern of
   organized hypocrisy whereby corporations in developed countries make
   discursive commitments without subsequent action. We also find that in
   developing countries, short-term trade relations exert greater influence
   on corporate CSR behavior than do long-term investment transactions.

AB Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However,
   a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral
   behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use
   identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity
   theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify
   their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on
   the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience
   negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue.
   Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations
   that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling
   rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural
   expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally.
   We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university
   students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing
   situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings
   reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are
   significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt
   and shame.

AB Following on an article in Bennett Berger (1990), Authors of Their Own
   Lives, titled "From Socialism to Sociology," in which I and other
   sociologists describe how we came to sociology, I continue with my
   academic and public career as a sociologist at the University of
   California-Berkeley (1963-1969) and at Harvard subsequently, in the
   Graduate School of Education and the Sociology Department. I describe my
   involvement in the formulation of urban policy in the Kennedy and
   Johnson administrations and beyond, and my attempt to understand the
   student revolt at Berkeley, which spread throughout the United States
   and indeed much of the world. I further discuss my long involvement in
   the issue of affirmative action, on which I in time changed my views,
   originally based on a distinctive conception of the course of ethnicity
   and ethnic and racial groups in the United States, from critical
   opposition to acceptance, and my similar involvement in the debates over
   social policy in the United States, in which a complex point of view has
   too often been summarized under the term neoconservatism.

AB Instrumental variable (IV) methods provide a powerful but underutilized
   tool to address many common problems with observational sociological
   data. Key to their successful use is having IVs that are uncorrelated
   with an equation's disturbance and that are sufficiently strongly
   related to the problematic endogenous covariates. This review briefly
   defines IVs, summarizes their origins, and describes their use in
   multiple regression, simultaneous equation models, factor analysis,
   latent variable structural equation models, and limited dependent
   variable models. It defines and contrasts three methods of selecting
   IVs: auxiliary instrumental variable, model implied instrumental
   variable, and randomized instrumental variable. It provides
   overidentification tests and weak IV diagnostics as methods to evaluate
   the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume
   heterogeneous causal effects. Another section summarizes the use of IVs
   in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways
   to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in
   which IVs could be profitably used in sociological research.

AB What is the relationship between social movements and electoral
   politics? Although the empirical reality of American politics has
   increasingly blurred the lines between activism and electoral politics,
   sociology has yet to explore these changes and provide theoretical and
   methodological tools to understand them. Focusing on the experience of
   young Americans, this review explores this relationship and outlines
   opportunities for future research. It is broken down into three
   sections. First, I review the main themes in the study of youth
   political participation in America. Second, using examples from the 2008
   election, the article examines recent increases in youth participation.
   Third and finally, this article discusses the case of the Obama
   campaign, its transition into the Democratic National Committee's
   Organizing for America, and aspects of the 2012 election to highlight
   the complex relationship between movements and electoral politics in
   America today. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities for
   sociologists to bridge the connections between activism and electoral
   politics in new and meaningful ways.

AB Although explicit attention to the role of small groups has waned in
   sociology, an empirical understanding of the interaction order is
   increasing. A focus on the group-the meso-level of analysis-enriches
   both structural and interactional approaches, stressing shared and
   ongoing meaning. Groups constitute social order, just as groups are
   themselves constituted by that order. The examination of local action
   reveals how interaction orders emerge and create meanings that spread
   throughout a wider network. Despite the limits of a meso-level analysis
   in examining both external webs of constraint and immediate
   negotiations, this approach addresses identity, social capital,
   collective action, group culture, networks, and civil society. By
   building on collective identity, shared history, common spaces, and
   ongoing social relations, groups provide mechanisms through which
   individuals fit into larger structures and through which social
   structures shape individuals.

   attracted considerable attention in recent years. The goal is to bring
   various bodies of work into conversation with one another in order to
   stimulate more cumulative theory building. This is accomplished by
   focusing on (a) subprocesses such as categorization and legitimation,
   (b) the conditions that sustain heterarchies, and (c) valuation and

AB I review and integrate recent sociological research that makes progress
   on three interrelated questions pertaining to social valuation: (a) the
   degree of social construction relative to objective constraints; (b) the
   degree of concentration in social valuations at a single point in time;
   and (c) the conditions that govern two broad forms of temporal
   discontinuity-(i) fashion cycles, especially in cultural expression and
   in managerial practices, and (ii) bubble/crash dynamics, as witnessed in
   such domains as authoritarian regimes and financial markets. In the
   course of the review, I argue for the importance of identifying how
   objective conditions constrain social construction and suggest two
   contrarian mechanisms by which this is accomplished-valuation
   opportunism and valuation entrepreneurship-and the conditions under
   which they are more or less effective.

AB In this article, I review three contemporary streams of scholarship that
   are revitalizing the cultural analysis of religion, an approach that
   dates to the discipline's founding. Research from an institutional field
   perspective focuses on the institutions that shape religious belief,
   practice, and mobilization. Work on lived religion, including
   neo-Durkheimian approaches, focuses on religious experience and
   contested practices of sacralization. Scholarship on religious cultural
   tools and symbolic boundaries analyzes religion as symbolic
   legitimation. These three approaches avoid serious problems associated
   with both market and secularization accounts, in part because of the way
   they conceptualize religious authority and religious identity, and in
   part because of their broader scope of inquiry. In the conclusion, I
   combine the insights from these approaches to articulate a promising
   agenda for future research, offering a set of focus questions that are
   relevant to both classical and contemporary concerns about religion's
   role in modern societies.

AB Status has become an increasingly influential concept in the fields of
   organizational and economic sociology during the past two decades.
   Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and
   between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of
   status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the
   contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the
   effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are
   produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has
   contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status
   hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value
   of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than
   focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential
   directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed
   efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and
   substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status
   processes.

AB Elites are those with vastly disproportionate control over or access to
   a resource. We can understand this as a position that a social actor
   occupies, or we can imagine such resources as a possession of an actor.
   The study of elites is the study of power and inequality, from above. It
   involves looking at the distribution of social resources, which can
   include economic, social, cultural, political, or knowledge capital. It
   also means exploring the role of institutions such as schools, families,
   and clubs in how such resources are organized and distributed. Over the
   past decade, particularly as social power and economic rewards have
   become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, elite
   sociology has experienced a revival. Empirical observations of these
   phenomena point to the changing character of American inequality.

AB We review the relationship between female labor supply and marital
   instability. Traditionally, the sociological literature has focused on
   the impact of female labor supply on the likelihood of divorce with
   specific reference to the independence hypothesis. However, recent
   studies in sociology and economics provide more consistent evidence that
   the direction of causality may be the other way around. Women might
   increase their labor supply in the anticipation of divorce. We review
   the methodological developments in measuring economic independence and
   the recent evidence on its impact on divorce. Then we turn our attention
   to the alternative literature on the impact of divorce on female labor
   supply. We outline the theoretical arguments put forward by this
   literature, discuss the methodological issues in establishing causality,
   summarize the findings, and suggest avenues of further research.

AB Cities in the Southern United States have experienced dynamic economic
   and population growth over the past half-century, challenging existing
   paradigms of urban form, race relations, social movements, and
   immigration. This review shows how the timing of Southern
   urbanization-much later than in the Northeast and Midwest-has
   contributed to Southern cities' distinctive spatial patterns and
   political and economic structures. Southern cities were crucial to
   regional transformation, including the Civil Rights Movement and the end
   of one-party rule in the South. Moreover, Southern cities exemplify key
   trends of the contemporary political economy: a new relationship to
   regional industrialization, new forms of entrepreneurial governance,
   flexible labor markets, the importance of finance and producer services,
   and "new destination" immigration. I conclude by examining two Southern
   cities for their relevance to central themes in contemporary social
   research: Atlanta for the study of the African American experience and
   New Orleans for the sociology of catastrophe.

AB Durkheim's emphasis on the role of emotion in social life has been
   influential in the development of the sociology of emotions. Others have
   analyzed Durkheim's distinctly social conception of reason and
   rationality. However, the interconnections between "emotion" and
   "reason" in his thinking have seldom been directly and systematically
   addressed. These interconnections deserve further explication and
   development, particularly as they apply to the level of language and
   action-i.e., "practical reason"-in everyday life. Seeing the collective
   emotional basis of "social facts," in general, and "logic," "reason,"
   and the basic "categories of the understanding," in particular, opens up
   new applications for Durkheim's broader theoretical framework.

AB Since World War II methods have advanced very quickly in sociology and
   social science, while this has not been the case with theory. In this
   article I suggest that one way of beginning to close the gap between the
   two is to focus on theorizing rather than on theory. The place where
   theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the
   context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for
   how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be
   successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing
   and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is
   made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only
   be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is
   called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is
   iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the
   basic rules for theorizing.

AB Recent studies show that firms and workers benefit from the geographic
   concentration or spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor
   market. While economic geographers have devoted considerable attention
   to the benefits firms receive from spatial agglomeration, the reasons
   workers may benefit in the form of higher wages are less clear. I draw
   from several theoretical perspectives in order to explain the
   relationship between spatial agglomeration and wages for U.S. biotech
   workers, including the new economic geography, new structuralism,
   organizational ecology, and the new economic sociology. Using the 1990
   PUMS-L, I employ a hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses
   from these perspectives. The results indicate that biotech workers
   benefit more from industrial than urban agglomeration, and these
   benefits are primarily due to the greater degree of organizational
   diversity in large industry clusters and urban labor markets.

AB The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple
   boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the
   community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and
   homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers
   on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on
   instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class
   sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three
   "moments": the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students'
   final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students'
   learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims,
   the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of
   drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data.
   The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond
   providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a
   laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the
   similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other
   disciplines.

AB This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be
   through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a
   three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination
   despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department.
   In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into
   racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into
   institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and
   their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the
   phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not
   to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the
   authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to
   learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the
   classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting
   students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for
   related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public
   sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the
   traditional classroom environment.

AB In recent years, academic programs have increasingly documented student
   learning. For many, this practice of measuring and analyzing student
   learning outcomes continues as an elusive endeavor fraught with
   resentment and misgiving. This article describes the development of a
   student learning assessment plan for the University of Wyoming's Chicano
   Studies Program. An initial program assessment facilitated the
   development of a faculty agreed-upon mission, goals, and learning
   outcomes. A summative course embedded assessment strategy provides
   direct evidence for determining student learning achievement. Student
   exit interviews provide additional evidence suggesting that Chicana/o
   Studies curricula help in cultivating a critical cultural thinking
   framework oriented toward social justice and activism. Current
   anti-immigrant and anti-Latina/o sentiments provide the context for a
   discussion of the study's implications.

AB Quantitative literacy is increasingly essential for both informed
   citizenship and a variety of careers. Though regression is one of the
   most common methods in quantitative sociology, it is rarely taught until
   late in students' college careers. In this article, the author describes
   a classroom-based activity introducing students to regression analysis
   in an introductory sociology course. Using a data set that draws on the
   students' quiz and exam scores, students learn the basics of
   interpreting regression analyses in a manner that is relevant to their
   own lives. The activity also encourages students to think critically
   about potential predictors of exam performance and how they could be
   measured.

AB A striking feature of modern societies is the extent to which individual
   persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The
   expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence
   in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception
   of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes
   promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the
   status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are
   substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries
   around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly
   asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms
   of socialization that promote active participation as well as the
   capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of
   533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries
   published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed
   become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the
   rising status of individuals and children in global human rights
   treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in
   countries with greater individualism embodied in political and
   socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world
   society. The study contributes to both political and educational
   sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on
   empowered individual agency in intended curricula.

AB Sociologists widely acknowledge that uncertainty matters for decision
   making, but they rarely measure it directly. In this article, we
   demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing
   uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel
   probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty
   about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using
   data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that
   uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young
   adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing
   HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight
   into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives.
   Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to
   accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are
   certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that
   personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can
   illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors.

AB The relationship between European sociology and European anti-Semitism
   in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is investigated through
   a case study of one sociologist, Emile Durkheim, in a single country,
   France. Reactionary and radical forms of anti-Semitism are distinguished
   and contrasted to Durkheim's sociological perspective. Durkheim's
   remarks about the Jews directly addressed anti-Semitic claims about
   them, their role in French society, and their relationship to modernity.
   At the same time, Durkheim was engaged in a reinterpretation of the
   French Revolution and its legacies that indirectly challenged other
   tenets of French anti-Semitism. In sum, Durkheim's work contains direct
   and indirect responses to reactionary and radical forms of
   anti-Semitism, and together these responses form a coherent alternative
   vision of the relationship between modernity and the Jews.

AB This article develops a research position that allows cultural
   sociologists to compare morality across sociohistorical cases. In order
   to do so, the article suggests focusing analytic attention on actions
   that fulfill the following criteria: (a) actions that define the actor
   as a certain kind of socially recognized person, both within and across
   fields; (b) actions that actors experienceor that they expect others to
   perceiveas defining the actor both intersituationally and to a greater
   extent than other available definitions of self; and (c) actions to
   which actors either have themselves, or expect others to have, a
   predictable emotional reaction. Such a position avoids both a realist
   moral sociology and descriptive-relativism, and provides sociologists
   with criteria for comparing moral action in different cases while
   staying attuned to social and historical specificity.

   entails problematic theoretical assumptions about stability and change
   and produces a circumscribed field of events, undercutting the goal of
   developing an eventful account of social life. Social continuity is a
   state that is achieved just as much as are structural transformations,

AB Current research on guanxi (Chinese social connections) suffers from
   conceptual confusion. This article presents a new theoretical framework
   for understanding guanxi in the face of China's economic and social
   transformations. Guanxi is viewed as a purposive network behavior that
   can take different strategic forms, such as accessing, bridging, and
   embedding. Pairing this conceptualization with a social-evolutionary
   framework, I argue that the emergence and increasing or decreasing
   prevalence of each form over time result from (1) a combination of
   factors at three analytical levelsmicroagency, mesonetwork, and
   macroinstitutionaland (2) endogenous processes of selection. By focusing
   on behavioral forms and their evolution, this framework is able to
   bridge divides in the guanxi literature, provide a foundation for
   comparative studies of network behavior across societies, and connect
   the study of guanxi with economic sociology more broadly.

   the "epistemic accident," grounded in a constructivist understanding of

AB By the turn of the 21st century the concept of globalization had earned
   its place in the social sciences and debate turned more squarely to the
   theoretical significance of globalization. Yet not all scholars were
   happy with the notion of globalization. Some claim that is merely a new
   name for earlier theories and concepts. Among those who reject new
   paradigmatic thinking on the current age is Immanuel Wallerstein, the
   world-renowned sociologist and 'father' of the world-system paradigm.
   This article is intended as an appraisal of Wallerstein's aeuvre in the
   context of the debate on global transformations in the late 20th and
   early 21st centuries and from the vantage point of the present author's
   own critical globalization perspective. The first three parts summarize
   and assess Wallerstein's theoretical system and his many contributions
   to macro, historical and comparative sociology, to development studies
   and international political economy. The fourth discusses Wallerstein's
   assessment of the evolution of the world capitalist system in recent
   decades, including his views on the concept of globalization, and the
   fifth focuses on earlier and more recent critical appraisals of his
   work, including the present author's own, in light of the recent
   transformations in world capitalism identified with globalization.

AB The goal of this article is to highlight the major trends in the

   conditions of globalization. Based on a review of research from library
   history and the sociology of culture, the author develops hypotheses
   about the conditions under which public libraries are likely to be
   established in relatively large numbers in developing countries.
   Analysis of historical trends in library establishments and crisp-set
   qualitative comparative analysis of UNESCO data on public libraries in
   six developing nations reveal that globalization is associated with
   decreasing or flat numbers of public libraries on a per capita basis.
   The only observed exceptions are Malaysia and Chile, where public
   libraries have been established in large numbers partly for purposes of
   national integration as a counter to sectarian and ethnic heterogeneity.
   Implications of these findings for research in the information society
   paradigm, and for development theory, are discussed.

   distinct contributions: first in terms of considering children's health
   disparities as an area of concern within sociology, and second by
   considering children's health as a factor that shapes other areas of
   children's well-being. In addition, these papers offer novel empirical
   research on children's health and varied methodological and theoretical
   orientations. Each paper also makes contributions to social policy,
   first in the area of infant health affecting later educational outcomes,
   second in the area of family structure and children's health, and
   additionally in understanding type 2 diabetes for children at the
   individual and structural levels. Finally, these studies highlight the

   Students compile questions and reflections throughout the course and, at
   the end of the term, use their writings for a comprehensive analytic
   self-reflection that examines their intellectual and sociological
   growth. Following Schwalbe's (2008) urging to emphasize sociological
   thinking over disciplinary nuances in introductory courses, we describe
   several complementary methods for teaching students how to think like
   sociologists. We detail five inquiry exercises and three reflection
   exercises that build up to the final analytic reflection essay. The
   unique value of these exercises is that students not only engage the
   course material throughout the course but also learn to examine their
   own writing as data. In doing so, students learn to value the process of
   learning, inquiry, and critical self-reflection while acquiring and

   employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked
   non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical
   professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment
   contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets,
   firms use non-competes to "strike back" against technical professionals'
   increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets.
   In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single
   industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of
   industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more
   likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their
   technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms
   strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such
   contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These
   findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in

   this impasse by creating a hegemony index to assess the power structure
   of the capitalist world-system. Though results support the world-economy
   view of three hegemons since the 16th century, findings also contradict
   this perspective and show that England is the most powerful nation
   during two successive hegemonic sequences. Conclusions highlight the
   possibility of hegemonic resuccession, while supplementary analysis

   rather as a situation in which transactional conditions for network
   desirability obtain but network governance is impeded either by
   ignorance or opportunism, or by a combination of the two. It depicts
   network failures as continuous rather than discrete outcomes, shows that
   they have more than one cause, and pays particular attention to two
   undertheorized-if not undiscovered-types of network failure (i.e.,
   involution and contested collaboration). It thereby contributes to the

AB The great German theorist Niklas Luhmann argued long ago that meaning is
   the central construct of sociology. We agree, but our scheme of
   stochastic processes-evolved over many years as identity and
   control-argues for switchings of intercalated bits of social network and
   interpretive domain (i.e., netdom switchings) as the core of meaning
   processes. We thus challenge Luhmann's central claim that modern
   society's subsystems are based on communicative self-closure. We assert
   that there is refuting evidence from sociolinguistics, from how
   languages are put together and how languages' indexical and reflexive
   devices (e.g., metapragmatics, heteroglossia, genres) are used in social
   action. Communication is about managing indexicalities, which entail
   great ambiguity and openness as they are anchored in myriad netdom
   switchings across social times and spreads. In contrast, Luhmann's
   concept of communication revolves around binary codes governed
   recursively and algorithmically within systems in efforts to reduce
   complexity from the environment. We conclude that systems closure does
   not solve the problem of uncertainty in social life. In fact, lack of
   uncertainty is itself a problem. Order is necessary, but order at the
   edge of chaos.

AB The political ideology of neoliberalism is widely recognized as having
   influenced the organization of national and global economies and public
   policies since the 1970s. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between the neoliberal variant of globalization and science. To do so,
   we develop a framework for sociology of science that emphasizes closer
   ties among political sociology, the sociology of social movements, and
   economic and organizational sociology and that draws attention to
   patterns of increasing and uneven industrial influence amid several
   countervailing processes. Specifically, we explore three fundamental
   changes since the 1970s: the advent of the knowledge economy and the
   increasing interchange between academic and industrial research and
   development signified by academic capitalism and asymmetric convergence;
   the increasing prominence of science-based regulation of technology in
   global trade liberalization, marked by the heightened role of
   international organizations and the convergence of scientism and
   neoliberalism; and the epistemic modernization of the relationship
   between scientists and publics, represented by the proliferation of new
   institutions of deliberation, participation, activism, enterprise, and
   social movement mobilization.

AB A satisfactory sociology of markets requires that both order and
   disorder in markets be addressed, yet sociologists have seemed more
   concerned with theorizing market stability and order. Change, however,
   is too fundamental a part of markets to receive so little sociological
   attention. One perspective that provides a fertile ground for moving
   ahead with developing an agenda for studying both stability and change
   in markets is American pragmatist social theory. This article therefore
   examines the influence of a pragmatist viewpoint on two broad modern
   theoretical approaches that have implications for the sociology of
   markets, one focused on stabilization processes, the other on
   institutional designs for promoting change. Most particularly, it draws
   on work carried out from a pragmatist viewpoint and illustrates a
   pragmatic approach to change in markets using the case of the EU's
   Forest, Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan and
   initiative.

AB Sociologists, philosophers, and historians of science tend to focus
   their attention on the production of knowledge. More recently, scholars
   have begun to investigate more fully the structures and processes that
   impede the production of knowledge. This article draws on interviews
   conducted with 41 academic researchers to present a phenomenological
   examination of "forbidden knowledge''-a phrase that refers to knowledge
   considered too sensitive, dangerous, or taboo to produce. Forbidden
   knowledge has traditionally been understood as a set of formal controls
   on what ought not be known. We argue that the social processes that
   create forbidden knowledge are embedded in the everyday practices of
   working scientists. The narrative legacies of past controversies in
   science are of particular importance, as they serve as a tool that
   working scientists use to justify, construct, and hide their acceptance
   of forbidden knowledge. As a result, the precise contents of forbidden
   knowledge are fluid, fuzzy, essentially contested, specialty specific,
   locally created, and enforced.

AB High performance work organizations (HPWOs) and their consequences in
   the workplace have gained a notable status in sociology and psychology
   of the workplace during the last three decades in the US and in the
   other industrialized nations. One area in which the ongoing debates and
   evidence are inconclusive is the job rewards associated with HPWOs in
   the manufacturing and service economies. Analysing functional and
   numerical flexibilities (the 'internalization' and 'externalization'
   strategies) adopted in the manufacturing and service sectors, this study
   intends to extend our understanding of associations between workplace
   restructuring (HPWOs) and job rewards. The findings reveal that
   'internalized' or standard employees have gained from internalization
   strategy with no significant differences between the two economic
   sectors. However, significant differences are disclosed when the
   consequences of externalization are contrasted between the sectors. The
   externalization strategy has significantly undermined job rewards for
   non-standard workers, except for independent contractors, especially in
   the manufacturing sector. The article ends with a short discussion on
   the theoretical significance of the findings and their policy
   implications in human sources management.

AB Budget exercises are frequently used in introductory and social problems
   courses to facilitate student understanding of income inequality. But do
   these exercises actually lead to greater sociological understanding? To
   explore this issue, the authors studied undergraduate students enrolled
   in introductory sociology courses during the 2008-2009 academic year.
   Using a unique pretest-pretest-posttest design, the authors captured
   student perceptions of issues of socioeconomic inequality at the
   beginning of the course, after completion of a traditional unit on
   stratification, and after participation in a budget exercise. The unique
   study design allows the authors to examine if and how students make
   gains in understanding inequality sociologically. They also consider
   other learning objectives, including fostering an appreciation of
   obstacles to social mobility and increasing general knowledge about
   inequality. The results suggest that both budget exercises and a
   traditional pedagogical unit of lecture, reading, and discussion play
   limited roles in fostering at least short-term sociological
   understanding as related to these goals.

   designed to simulate common, everyday experiences among people living in
   poverty as participants take on the roles of family members working to
   make ends meet. The creators of CAPS emphasize that "CAPS is not a game"
   but "a unique tool that community action agencies are able to use to
   educate everyone, from policy makers to community leaders, about the day
   to day realities of life with a shortage of money and an abundance of
   stress." The authors facilitated the CAPS program with two large groups
   of undergraduate students enrolled in sociology, gerontology, and
   psychology courses at a medium-sized private college in south-central
   Pennsylvania. The analysis examines the experiential learning outcomes
   of the students as they reflect on their participation in the
   simulation. Following participation in CAPS, the students demonstrated
   an increased awareness of the material conditions of everyday life among
   families living in poverty.

   roles. The findings show stereotypical depictions beyond glasses, bow
   ties, and tweed jackets. Specifically, the authors find stereotypical
   images of race and gender as well as an emphasis on the importance of
   research, sometimes at the expense of teaching or ethical behavior. This
   research provides instructors with knowledge of the stereotypes that
   students may have upon entering the college classroom, which may impact
   classroom interactions, and provides insight into how race and gender

AB Rightwing theorists argue that we owe the current financial crisis to
   the democratization of credit, or financial inclusion: politics
   interfered with the market to benefit marginalized actors, only to cause
   instability and risk. Leftwing theorists focus instead on
   financialization: namely, the shift of profit-making activities from
   industry to finance. These views implicitly draw on Schumpeter and Marx.
   Much like their intellectual progenitors, they emphasize exogenous
   processes to explain financial change. Here I claim that the connection
   between financial innovation and financial inclusion is endogenous. I
   suggest two main typologies of financial innovators: Market Utopians
   (MUs) and Populist Innovators (PIs). Financial inclusion, I submit, is
   the byproduct of the quest for power of the latter.

AB Many theories of social construction make some reference to sight, yet
   few offer sustained examinations of perception. In light of this, I
   highlight the visual dimension of the social construction of reality by
   analyzing visual perception as a process of 'socio-mental filtration'.
   Building on theories of social construction - most notably those using
   the concepts 'frame', 'paradigm' and 'schema' in which expectations are
   the organizing force of experience, I focus on how social construction
   happens. One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention,
   which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on
   the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to
   identify the specific dynamics of 'socio-optical construction' - adding
   a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social
   construction - may help scholars to more effectively account for some of
   the 'hard problems' of constructionist theory, such as the body.

AB This paper links the work of Sebastiao Salgado, recipient of the 2010

   Reporting of Social Issues, with the discipline of sociology. I reflect
   on Salgado's biography, method, and concerns in order to demonstrate how
   his work contributes to the awareness and understanding of social
   issues. Toward this end, I summarize sociology's record of involvement
   with visual documentation. Prior to 1915, the American Journal of
   Sociology regularly included photographs that provided visual
   documentation of environments under study. However, as sociology moved
   away from social reform activities and toward scientific investigation,
   the regular publication of photographs ceased. During the 1930s and
   1940s, photographic projects in disciplines and social movements beyond
   sociology developed a variety of methods that would prove useful to
   sociology. During the 1970s, sociologists once again began to use visual
   methods in their teaching, research, and publication, putting sociology
   in the position to both contribute to and benefit from insights and
   social commitments that have distinguished Sebastiao Salgado as a
   globally significant photographer and social activist during the late
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

   particular, this analysis examines how women came to be included in the

   attitudes and samples drawn from a statewide and a national population
   in 2007, we find support for the religious and political bases of
   farm-animal-welfare attitudes. Frequent church attendance is related to
   less concern with animal welfare. However, we also find that religious
   beliefs can be a source of support for animal welfare. Political
   orientation as reflected by desire for more economic equality and
   greater tolerance of outgroups is also related to concern for
   farm-animal welfare. Formal political partisanship and denomination have
   weaker effects. Concern with farm-animal welfare is consistently related
   to greater concern with human welfare in the food sector.

AB Sociology has long shied away from the problem of populism. This may be
   due to suspicion about the concept or uncertainty about how to fit
   populist cases into broader comparative matrices. Such caution is
   warranted: the existing interdisciplinary literature has been plagued by
   conceptual confusion and disagreement. But given the recent resurgence
   of populist politics in Latin America and elsewhere, sociology can no
   longer afford to sidestep such analytical challenges. This article moves
   toward a political sociology of populism by identifying past theoretical
   deficiencies and proposing a new, practice-based approach that is not
   beholden to pejorative common sense understandings. This approach
   conceptualizes populism as a mode of political practice-as populist
   mobilization. Its utility is demonstrated through an application to
   mid-twentieth-century Latin American politics. The article concludes by
   sketching an agenda for future research on populist mobilization in
   Latin America and beyond.

AB A major problem with the emerging sociological literature on
   cosmopolitanism is that it has not adequately theorized mechanisms that
   mediate the presumed causal relationship between globalization and the
   development of cosmopolitan orientations. To solve this problem, I draw
   on Bruno Latour's actor-network theory (ANT) to theorize the development
   of three key elements of cosmopolitanism: cultural omnivorousness,
   ethnic tolerance, and cosmopolitics. ANT illuminates how humans and
   nonhumans of multiple nationalities develop attachments with one another
   to create network structures that sustain cosmopolitanism. ANT also
   helps the sociology of cosmopolitanism become more reflexive and
   critical of its implicit normative claims.

AB Past research recognizes that firms exploit regulatory variations to
   their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic
   process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by
   including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view
   regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity
   structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their
   rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws
   that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22
   U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze
   how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and
   exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and
   non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new
   stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the
   borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW
   states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of
   regulation, social movements, and organizations.

AB This article moves beyond current controversies on the nature of money
   by suggesting that a general social process allows different kinds of
   organizations and networks-from states to banks to local communities-to
   produce currencies: that is, the articulation of criteria of
   creditworthiness, or what I call the exercise of moral authority.
   Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is
   contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of
   creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I
   illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum
   United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed
   to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a
   process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I
   conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral
   authority, which have made the local level a springboard for
   destabilizing financial innovations.

AB The sociology of aging draws on a broad array of theoretical

   own. We build on past work to advance and empirically test a model of
   mental health framed in terms of structural theorizing and situated
   within the life course perspective. Whereas most prior research has been
   based on cross-sectional data, we utilize four waves of data from a
   nationally representative sample of American adults (Americans' Changing
   Lives Study) collected prospectively over a 15-year period and find that
   education, employment and marital status, as well as their consequences
   for income and health, effectively explain the increase in depressive
   symptoms after age 65. We also found significant cohort differences in
   age trajectories of mental health that were partly explained by
   historical increases in education. We demonstrate that a purely
   structural theory can take us far in explaining later life mental
   health.

AB Religious leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa do not just deal with the
   spiritual needs of members but are also heavily engaged in dealing with
   social problems and material needs. Although true elsewhere, the
   realities of limited state infrastructure and an increasingly diverse
   religious landscape make it crucial for religious entrepreneurs to deal
   with material problems if they hope to gain adherents. This article
   applies the concepts of problem solving and brokerage (Burt, 2005;
   Knoke, 1990) to a case study of religious leaders in Balaka, a small
   town of rural Malawi. I argue that religious leaders solve problems in
   three major areas-material infrastructure, activities and organization,
   and healthcare-and that they are able to do so at least partly because
   of their connections to various overlapping secular and religious
   networks. I focus both on the provision of material resources and the
   facilitation of effervescent experiences in order to advance a fuller
   understanding of the experience of poverty and the ways leaders in poor
   communities work to solve problems.

AB This study revisits and extends a classic question in sociology and
   tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational
   social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at
   midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of
   intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during
   adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress
   and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological
   problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of
   prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This
   study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that
   breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and
   intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current
   class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological
   distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to
   resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the
   outcomes of study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has conceptualized sustainability as the environmental

   footprint per capita (a measure of environmental consumption) and
   average life satisfaction (a measure of subjective well-being). We draw
   hypotheses from political economy, modernization, and sustainable
   consumption theories in the environmental social sciences. Using full

   climate, political, economic, and social factors on EWEB with a sample
   of 105 countries. Key findings include a negative quadratic effect of
   economic development on EWEB, a negative effect of income inequality,
   and a positive effect of social capital. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB When something serves a function, it is easy to overlook its origins.
   The tendency is to proceed directly to function and retroactively
   construct a story about origin based on the function it fills. In this
   article, I address this problem of origins as it appears in the
   sociology of knowledge, using a case study of the publication of the 3rd
   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-III) in 1980. The manual revolutionized American psychiatry and the
   treatment of mental illness, because it served the function of
   classification that had become critical to the field of mental health by
   this time. But this function must be bracketed in order to reveal the
   "extra-functional" origins of the DSM-III. Using field theory, I argue
   that the manual was necessary for reasons other than the function it
   filled as a classification. Specifically, its origin lies in a series of
   conflicts among psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and clinical
   psychologists within the field of mental health, which followed in the
   wake of the collapse of psychoanalysis as the dominant treatment type
   for mental illness. I reveal the generative formula behind the
   production of the DSM-III, capturing a variety of social processes that
   influenced the format of the manual and made it a useful classification,
   but which are not reducible to function. In this way, I reproduce its
   raison d'etre in a manner similar to how the DSM-III appeared for the
   people who produced it. This focus on generative formulas offers the
   sociology of knowledge a way to capture the epistemic importance of a
   range of different social processes. Most importantly, it avoids the
   functional fallacy of reducing origin to function, and ignoring the idea
   that innovations might appear necessary even without clear recognition
   of their functional consequences.

   sociology departments are in fact conducting some form of assessment,
   although faculty members often are critical of these activities. The

   in carrying out assessment plans by virtue of their disciplinary
   training and skills in analyzing data. Further, the authors appeal to
   readers of Teaching Sociology that assessment and the scholarship of
   teaching and learning are inextricably linked and that it requires only
   a small step from conducting research on the scholarship of teaching and

AB The use of informal writing is common in sociology. This article
   presents one model for integrating informal written work with learning
   goals through a theoretical framework known as concentric thinking. More
   commonly referred to as 'the PTA model' because of the series of
   cognitive tasks it promotes-prioritization,translation, and analogy
   (PTA)-concentric thinking practiced through PTA provides a basis for
   structuring students' informal writing over the course of a semester.
   The authors present data in which students use PTA to assess their
   journal entries as text at the end of the semester. The students'
   informal responses to their own writing demonstrate the achievement of
   an important course goal-the development of sociological
   mindfulness-while they also reveal a deeper understanding of the
   important features of written work. The authors conclude that when
   informal writing is purposefully linked to a set of thinking goals and
   learning outcomes that are necessary to complete formal course
   requirements, it can serve as a powerful teaching tool to enhance both
   thinking and the ability to convey thoughts in writing. Structured in
   this way, informal written work can enable us to observe and assess
   changes in students' learning that would otherwise remain invisible, and
   it can alter our pedagogy in fundamental ways.

AB This article examines Bourdieu's contributions to history and historical
   sociology. Bourdieu has often been misread as an ahistorical
   'reproduction theorist' whose work does not allow for diachronic change
   or human agency. The article argues both that reproduction and social
   change, constraint and freedom, are at the heart of Bourdieu's project.
   Bourdieu's key concepts - habitus, field, cultural and symbolic capital
   - are all inherently historical. Bourdieu deploys his basic categories
   using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the
   ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical
   discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu's historicism are traced to his
   teachers at the Ecole Normale Superieure and to the long-standing
   aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two
   disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu's work is also signalled
   by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his
   former students and colleagues. Bourdieu allowed sociology to
   historicize itself to a greater extent than other French sociologists.

   are justified in speaking of Bourdieu's economic sociologies in the
   plural. While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction
   (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the
   fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he
   had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work
   in Algeria on 'the economy of honour and "good faith" (1950s and 1960s);
   his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the
   economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three
   studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's
   attempt to formulate a general program for 'economic anthropology' in
   his article 'The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as
   field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at
   Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.

AB In contrast to recent US studies showing a decrease in core network
   size, our Kenyan data reveals substantial network growth. We attribute
   this to the diffusion of mobile telephones. Results from pooled survey
   data from Nairobi professionals and entrepreneurs in 2002 and 2007 as
   well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation
   in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of
   technology use. What explains this puzzle is a network effect of mobile
   telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a
   context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and
   the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data
   before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this
   interpretation, showing that mobile phones are a crucial resource in
   managing interpersonal networks for instrumental purposes. (C) 2010

AB Ideas from Randall Collins's Sociology of Philosophies are applied to
   U.S. criminology, a policy-oriented field and one case of
   differentiation out of a fragmented sociological discipline. Building on
   previous quantitative work, in-depth interviews with eight prominent
   scholars provide the empirical material. As in philosophy, vertical
   network ties are important. Yet, they may take different forms, with
   consequences for the shape of horizontal networks and the nature of
   scholarship. Comparable to philosophy, horizontal network ties provide
   social capital and opportunities for interaction rituals that generate
   collective effervescence and emotional energy. Further, the nature of
   these interactions is dependent on the changing institutional
   environment in which they are embedded. Such institutional settings,
   themselves affected by changes in the political economy, also provide
   material resources, constituting dependencies that produce mediated
   effects and, in this policy-oriented field, also direct effects on the
   nature of scholarship.

   "chains" of emotions over time. Qualitative and quantitative data
   together generate a multifaceted understanding of emotions' interactions
   over time and their independent and combined ability to predict who
   returns to the events a year later. Previous work on emotions and
   movement recruitment has confined itself to whether emotional
   experiences were positive or negative or focused in depth on one
   particular emotion. This article's findings show that confusion,

AB This article employs evidence from a literature within social psychology
   on the malleability of scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a
   measure that is widely used to assess implicit attitudes, and other
   implicit cognition measures, to provide a theoretical framework for
   incorporating implicit processes into sociological accounts of culture.
   Studies from this literature demonstrate the fundamentally contextual
   and interactional nature of implicit cognition; that is, how the
   cultural environment shapes the activation of cognitive associations.
   Understanding how culture works to influence behavior requires attention
   to the interaction between the cultural environment-including symbols
   and media, place, situations, and networks-and cognitive
   representations. Using this theoretical framework, I discuss how
   evidence from the sociology of culture regarding the nature of this
   cultural environment can inform our understanding of culture in action.

   in-depth interviews to surveys. This research note describes an
   alternative approach of amassing in-depth qualitative accounts and
   content coding them for statistical analysis. Funding requirements for
   such projects are minimal and students can easily be involved-providing
   important training opportunities that broaden their appreciation of and
   expertise in diverse methodologies. Such endeavors thus present valuable
   opportunities for advancing training and research. We illustrate how
   this approach has been applied in a project focusing on workplace
   ethnographies. We conclude with a discussion of additional bodies of
   ethnographic research similarly ripe for systematic analysis.

AB Within this paper we offer what is hopefully both a suggestive (as

   signposting of the ontological, epistemological, and methodological
   boundaries framing the putative intellectual project that is Physical
   Cultural Studies (PCS). Ground in a commitment toward engaging varied
   dimensions or expressions of active physicality, we deliberate on an
   understanding of, and approach to, the corporeal practices, discourses,
   and subjectivities through which active bodies become organized,
   represented, and experienced in relation to the operations of social
   power. Further, drawing on Toby Miller, we suggest that this approach
   requires a motivation toward progressive social change. We consider the
   political and axiological contingencies of PCS, how it is differentiated
   from the "sociology of sport," and how we may produce the type of
   knowledge that is able to intervene into the broader social world and
   make a difference. We are sure many will disagree-perhaps with good
   reason-with our assumptions. Indeed, such differences are welcomed for
   we feel that there is greater progressive potential in a field in
   tension, in healthy contestation, and, in which debates surrounding
   ontology, epistemology, political intent, method, interpretation,
   expression, and impact flow freely.

AB This article discusses how organizations can resist normative
   institutional pressures associated with the use of formally trained and
   credentialed professionals. This research draws on neoinstitutional
   theories of isomorphism and utilizes a framework of religious training
   developed by <link rid="b25">Finke and Dougherty (2002), which
   emphasizes both the social and religious capital gained during
   professionalization, to show that resistance to normative institutional
   pressures is possible. The data demonstrate that organizations which act
   to reformulate the role of religious professionals in a way which limits
   both the opportunities and ability of clergy to implement and maintain
   organizational routines and processes can successfully avoid normative
   institutional forces. This research draws on over 50 interviews and 100
   hours of fieldwork with people in the Emerging Church, a religious
   movement that has arisen in the last 25 years as a response to
   increasing distrust of institutional authority. This study helps to
   close the gap between institutional studies of organizations and the
   sociology of religion by suggesting that some, currently overlooked,
   organizational activities can be more accurately understood as
   deliberate attempts to resist institutionalizing forces.

AB The list experiment is used to detect latent beliefs when researchers
   suspect a substantial degree of social desirability bias from
   respondents. This methodology has been used in areas ranging from racial
   attitudes to political preferences. Meanwhile, social psychologists
   interested in the salience of physical attributes to social behavior
   have provided respondents with experimentally altered photographs to
   test the influence of particular visual cues or traits on social
   evaluations. This experimental research has examined the effect of skin
   blemishes, hairlessness, and particular racial attributes on
   respondents' evaluation of these photographs. While this approach
   isolates variation in particular visual characteristics from other
   visual aspects that tend to covary with the traits in question, it fails
   to adequately deal with social desirability bias. This shortcoming is
   particularly important when concerned with potentially charged visual
   cues, such as body mass index (BMI). The present article describes a
   novel experiment that combines the digital alteration of photographs
   with the list experiment approach. When tested on a nationally
   representative sample of Internet respondents, results suggest that when
   shown photographs of women, male respondents report differences in
   levels of attractiveness based on the perceived BMI of the photographed
   confederate. Overweight individuals are less likely than their normal
   weight peers to report different levels of attractiveness between
   high-BMI and low-BMI photographs. Knowing that evaluations of
   attractiveness influence labor market outcomes, the findings are
   particularly salient in a society with rising incidence of obesity.

AB A common complaint about the sociology of deviance, particularly the
   perspective known as labeling theory or the societal reaction
   perspective, is that the field is dead. However, considerable evidence
   suggests that the core themes of societal reaction work live on in
   several areas of contemporary scholarship. After identifying and
   describing three key strands of the early societal reaction perspective,
   I consider how those strands are reflected in more recent work, much of
   which does not explicitly reference the earlier tradition. I identify
   the ways that recent scholarship builds upon and yet extends the earlier
   societal reaction tradition. I close by describing three trajectories
   emerging in recent work that should focus future inquiry: the contingent
   effects of labeling, the causes of gaps between social control discourse
   and practice, and the diffusion of social control practices from
   deviants to nondeviants.

AB Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociological attention to
   understanding the roots of self-destruction has been inconsistent. hi
   this review, we use three historical periods of interest (pre-Durkheim,
   Durkheim, post-Durkheim) to organize basic findings in the body of
   sociological knowledge regarding suicide. Much of the twentieth-century
   research focused on issues of integration and regulation, imitation, and
   the social construction of suicide rates. Innovations in the
   twenty-first-century resurgence of sociological research on suicide are
   described in detail. These newer studies begin to redirect theory and
   analysis toward a focus on ethnoracial subgroups, individual-level
   phenomena (e.g., ideation), and age-period-cohort effects. Our analysis
   of sociology's contributions, limits, and possibilities leads to a
   recognition of the need to break through bifurcations in individual- and
   aggregate-level studies, to pursue the translation of Durkheim's
   original theory into a network perspective as one avenue of guiding
   micro-macro research, and to attend to the complexity in both
   multidisciplinary explanations and pragmatic interventions.

AB Sociologists have developed a wide range of pedagogical strategies to
   facilitate student learning about racial/ethnic, class, and gender
   inequalities. Despite the growing subdiscipline of the sociology of the
   body and evidence pointing to the prevalence of inequalities based on
   physical attractiveness, the pedagogical literature has yet to develop
   strategies for teaching students about biases based on physical
   attractiveness. In this article, the authors report on a pedagogical
   module that involves student evaluations of photographs (depicting
   individuals ranging in levels of physical attractiveness) using semantic
   differential scales, and discuss the results of this evaluation. The
   authors test for student learning outcomes through (1) a one-group
   pretest-posttest design and (2) an assessment survey with both
   qualitative and quantitative components. Because this photograph
   evaluation typically illustrates students' beauty biases, a discussion
   of these results, paired with relevant readings, provides a powerful
   tool for the exchange of ideas about physical attractiveness biases.

AB Research into environmental concern and behavior has been extensive in
   the past few decades. The connection between the two, as well as other
   related variables, has however remained somewhat elusive. This study
   attempts to refine our understanding of how concern for the environment
   is related to pro-environmental behavior such as buying ecologically
   friendly products, driving less, conserving resources at home,
   recycling, etc., by considering the role played by social structural
   context and self-efficacy. Furthermore, through principle component
   analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is
   identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social
   structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators
   of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental
   behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the
   availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to
   additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling.

AB In contrast to the antistructuralist and antipositivist agenda that has
   animated the "narrative turn" in the social sciences since the 1980s, a
   more uniquely sociological approach has studied stories in the
   interactional, institutional, and political contexts of their telling.
   Scholars working in this vein have seen narrative as powerful, but as
   variably so, and they have focused on the ways in which narrative
   competence is socially organized and unevenly distributed. We show how
   this approach, or cluster of approaches, rooted variously in
   conversational analysis, symbolic interactionism, network analysis, and
   structuralist cultural sociologies, has both responded to problems
   associated with the narrative turn and shed light on enduring
   sociological questions such as the bases of institutional authority, how
   inequalities are maintained and reproduced, why political challengers
   are sometimes able to win support, and the cultural foundations of
   self-interest and instrumental rationality.

AB A significant group of sociologists entering graduate school in the late
   1960s and 1970s embraced Marxism as the foundation for a critical
   challenge to reigning orthodoxies in the discipline. In this review, we
   ask what impact this cohort of scholars and their students had on the
   mainstream of American sociology. More generally, how and in what ways
   did the resurgence of neo-Marxist thought within the discipline lead to
   new theoretical and empirical research and findings? Using two models of
   Marxism as science as our guide, we examine the impact of sociological
   Marxism on research on the state, inequality, the labor process, and
   global political economy. We conclude with some thoughts about the
   future of sociological Marxism.

AB Sociological theories about the political economy of the environment
   have appeared in two waves. The first wave has a productivist
   orientation, showing how the normal workings of industrial production
   damage the environment. It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT),
   the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource
   extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of
   theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements
   that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest
   over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist
   policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate
   environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged
   and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and
   sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded,
   articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns.
   Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of
   first- and second-wave theories. This theoretical focus may shift toward
   the political economy of disasters as climate change intensifies.

AB The economic crisis of 2008-2010 stimulated an already growing
   sociological interest in finance. Before the crisis, disintermediation
   and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as
   bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to
   originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size
   and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed
   financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital
   market integration and liberalization created greater global
   interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered
   their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and
   overall exposure to the stock market. Research reveals the importance of
   politics for many financial market developments, various implications
   for corporate governance, the continuing significance of social factors
   within finance, and the role of theoretical and material devices in
   shaping financial practices. Key directions for future research focus on
   finance in relation to social inequality, informal sectors, valuation,
   and social networks.

AB The American conservative movement that began to gain steam in the
   post-World War II era had, by the 1980s, emerged as a transformative
   political force in the United States and the world. Yet sociology has
   been slower than other disciplines to come to grips with conservatism.
   In the hope of spurring more research, we review the substantial
   literature on the conservative movement produced by historians,
   political scientists, and serious journalists since the mid-1990s, along
   with the more limited number of sociological contributions. After
   identifying what we see as a promising approach for conceptualizing
   conservatism, we illustrate the benefits of sociological engagement by
   showing how three areas of sociology that might at first glance seem
   disconnected from the movement the-sociology of intellectuals, theories
   of social change, and scholarship on stratification-could profit from
   consideration of the conservative case.

AB Sociology is poised to greatly enhance our collective understanding of
   the various sustainability challenges facing the world today To
   contribute to this endeavor the authors conduct panel analyses of the
   per capita ecological footprints of nations to evaluate multiple
   theoretical traditions within environmental sociology and its sister
   approaches Findings indicate that the consumption-based environmental
   impacts of nations are tied to economic development urban population,
   militarization, and the structure of international trade Ecological
   conditions in the context of climate and biogeography also prove to
   partially shape the environmental harms of human activities Ultimately
   this research suggests that political-economic factors, ecological
   milieu and structural associations between nations all influence
   society/nature relationships Considering the globally unsustainable
   levels of resource consumption and concomitant increases in pollution
   for a growing number of nations throughout the world the authors contend
   that theoretically inclusive and methodologically rigorous
   investigations on such topics should be more central to the discipline

   investigate the consequences of organizational de-coupling from an
   inward-looking within organizational perspective Specifically we study
   how the de-coupling of flexible work program affects workers
   actualization of productivity Our data analysis suggests that the
   organizational de-coupling in which organizations only ceremonially
   adopt flexible work program without making it available to all workers,
   is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were
   bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of
   productivity actualization is associated with workers who enjoy a
   factual flexible work schedule which is nevertheless not formally
   adopted by the employer The implications of the findings are discussed

AB This article introduces a sociology role-playing game (RPG) used to
   demonstrate the broad range of social forces, institutions, and
   structures in a semester-long series of in-class and homework
   assignments. RPGs and other simulation games have been frequently
   suggested as a useful teaching methodology because of their unique
   ability to allow students to observe and analyze society from a new
   perspective; however, most games are limited in scope. We present a game
   that is based on a clearly articulated theoretical foundation, reflects
   contemporary American demographics, and recreates the full breadth of
   social structures and relationships. The result is a robust teaching
   tool that develops critical thinking skills, encourages the sociological
   imagination, and is applicable to a wide range of classes and topics.
   Informal student feedback and student evaluations indicate that students
   enjoy the game, that it aids students in understanding sociological
   concepts, and that it encourages social critique beyond the classroom.

AB P>The current call for public scholarship and community engagement by
   universities and disciplinary organizations has created opportunities to
   develop innovative ways to integrate research, instruction, and
   outreach. This article discusses a collaboration among scholars at the
   University of Kentucky and alternative agrifood movement organizations
   that has evolved as they pursue an alternative agrifood system in
   Kentucky. This collaboration made instructional programs in sociology
   and the honors world food issues track places in which both students and
   instructors can examine "problems" of the conventional agrifood system,
   conduct research, and develop collaborative relationships with community
   activists. We draw on Burawoy's discussion of public sociology and its
   interface with professional, critical, and policy sociologies.
   Supplementing our discussion with literature from social movements and
   science studies, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can render
   sociological knowledge and skills useful as critical support of
   alternative agrifood movements. We argue that the "experiential
   classroom" is an excellent site for the critical examination within the
   agrifood movements of oppositional culture. This, in turn, makes
   possible students' recognition of injustice in the existing agrifood
   system.

AB This article engages with problems that are usually opaque: What
   trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific
   community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that?
   We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific
   contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box
   imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that
   as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall
   network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now
   considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the
   non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to
   currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular
   phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting
   meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a
   niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a
   typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en
   route to consensus.

   sociology has tended to see this work as the exercise of tacit or
   embodied knowledge, curatorial knowledge and plans may be elaborated and
   altered by the situated actions of exhibition installation. While
   curators know a successful installation "when they see it," this depends
   on the indexical particularities of artworks and environments which
   cannot be predicted in advance. In demonstrating the practical ways in
   which culture is mobilized in situations of object (inter) action, this
   paper emphasizes the "making" in artistic meaning-making.

AB Culture has long shaped individuals' response to problems. A classic
   puzzle in the sociology of health and illness is discrepancy between
   theory and research regarding cultural beliefs and medical care service
   use. "Utilization research," examining individuals' responses to the
   onset of health problems, has not consistently found an effect of
   culture on the uptake of formal treatment. While ethnographic research
   often describes how culture shapes illness behaviors, survey-based
   studies rarely find significant effects of predispositions once "need"
   is controlled. In quantitative studies, individuals report supportive
   treatment beliefs or predispositions to use services but low utilization
   levels, reinforcing claims about lack of utility of cultural ideologies
   in health-care decision making. We ask whether innovations in the
   sociology of culture and cognition provide the theoretical scaffolding
   to conceptualize and measure culture in health service utilization.
   Examining data from the General Social Survey, we focus on how different
   approaches to culture might explain the paradox of high cultural
   predispositions and low actual use. Children with mental health problems
   provide a comparison between suggestions and endorsements. Suggestions,
   sources of care offered by individuals in response to a case description
   without any other social cues, align with new cultural approaches, and
   are measured by responses to open-ended questions about what should be
   done for the child described (meeting clinical criteria for ADHD, major
   depression, asthma, or "daily troubles"). Endorsements, requiring less
   cognitive work and cultural resistance, align with traditional
   conceptualizations of culture, and are measured by closed-ended
   questions that ask respondents to agree or disagree with seeking help
   from different treatment options placed later in the survey. We find
   that suggestions reveal cultural predispositions to use services
   corresponding closely to reported utilization levels; endorsements
   reveal high, unrealistic cultural predispositions to use services.
   Further, suggestions are associated with sociodemographics that proxy
   culture (e.g., race), while endorsements are associated only with
   perceived need.

AB Despite sociology's longstanding interest in inequality, the
   internalization of racial oppression among the racially subordinated and
   its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been
   largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently,
   internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood
   components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by
   defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and
   the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the
   concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on
   critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a
   theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism,
   and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by
   offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance
   concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression.

AB Sociology requires a robust theory of how local circumstances create
   social order. When we analyze social structures not recognizing that
   they depend on groups with collective pasts and futures that are
   spatially situated and that are based on personal relations, we avoid a
   core sociological dimension: the importance of local context in
   constituting social worlds. Too often this has been the sociological
   stance, both in micro-sociological studies that examine interaction as
   untethered from local traditions and in research that treats culture as
   autonomous from action and choice. Building on theories of action, group
   dynamics, and micro-cultures, I argue that a sociology of the local
   solves critical theoretical problems. The local is a stage on which
   social order gets produced and a lens for understanding how particular
   forms of action are selected. Treating ethnographic studies as readings
   of ongoing cultures, I examine how the continuing and referential
   features of group life (spatial arenas, relations, shared pasts)
   generate action and argue that local practices provide the basis for
   cultural extension, influencing societal expectations through the
   linkages among groups.

   and values of individuality, self-expression, and pleasure seeking in
   the areas of work and consumption. By broadening our conception of the
   spirit of capitalism, tracing the formation of capitalist dispositions
   as well as institutions, and showing that the culture of capitalism can
   come from within the old regime, I further the agenda of neoclassical

   U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and
   Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations
   Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model
   of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market
   between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that
   industry of employment represents a salient partition of the
   distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the
   current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were
   displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings
   losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment
   in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed
   determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that
   displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses
   in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch
   industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage
   industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those
   who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be
   explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs
   from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are
   re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural
   theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which
   represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic
   skill-based accounts of earnings differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   the sacred and profane binaries that structure meaning even in

   totemism, it also reflects the eschatological hopes for salvation that

   quality. Using face-to-face interviews with probability samples surveys

   also determined, from open-ended questions, people's understandings of
   'the environment' and 'economic growth' and the priority trade-offs
   between them that are often implied and debated. The analyses found
   striking similarities as well as differences in the two metropolitan
   areas.

AB This conceptual article draws on literature in the sociology of science
   on modelling. The authors suggest that if state theory can be
   conceptualized as an 'engine' rather than merely a 'camera', in that
   policy is mobilized to make the world fit the theory, then this has
   implications for conceptualizing states. To examine this possibility the
   authors look through the lens of actor-network theory (ANT) and in doing
   so articulate a relationship between two models of the state in the
   literature. They find that an 'actor model' of the state is accepted by
   many scholars, few of whom develop 'network models' of the state. In
   response, this study introduces an actor-network model and proposes that
   its contribution to state theory is in rethinking the character of
   modern states to be the outcome of actually performed assemblages of all
   those practices of building it, protecting it, governing it and
   theorizing about it.

AB Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located
   stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC).
   Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that
   Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor,
   unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a
   shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper
   examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of
   176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the
   US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are
   disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with
   a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three
   further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First,
   findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and
   economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated
   rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town.
   Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race,
   town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly,
   future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological
   implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison
   impact. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative,
   based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The
   article highlights the structural features of narrative-basically, the
   organization of the genre around the semantic template
   actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but
   where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the
   verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet,
   such as time and space of action-and shows how to implement this
   structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological
   tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism,
   1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An
   Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color
   circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from
   Newton to Goethe-and the quality versus quantity debate-to Goethe and
   Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.

AB In this article, I attempt to address some enduring problems in
   formulation and practical use of the notion of structure in contemporary
   social science. I begin by revisiting the question of the fidelity of
   Anthony Giddens' appropriation of the idea of structure with respect to
   Levi-Strauss. This requires a reconsideration of Levi-Strauss' original
   conceptualization of "social structure" which I argue is a sort of
   "methodological structuralism" that stands sharply opposed to Giddens'
   ontological reconceptualization of the notion. I go on to show that
   Bourdieu's contemporaneous critique of Levi-Strauss is best understood
   as an attempt to recover rather than reject the central implication of
   Levi-Strauss' methodological structuralism, which puts Bourdieu and
   Giddens on clearly distinct camps in terms of their approach toward the
   idea of structure. To demonstrate the-insurmountable-conceptual
   difficulties inherent in the ontological approach, I proceed by
   critically examining what I consider to be the most influential attempt
   to resolve the ambiguities in Giddens structuration theory: Sewell's
   argument for the "duality of structure." I show that by retaining
   Giddens' ontological focus, Sewell ends up with a notion of structure
   that is at its very core "anti-structuralist" or only structuralist in a
   weak sense. I close by considering the implications of the analysis for
   the possibility of developing the rather neglected "methodological
   structuralist" legacy in contemporary social analysis.

AB Increasingly, educators have called on colleges and universities to
   prepare their students for a more interdependent world. While sociology
   has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to
   implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus
   on what ''internationalizing'' or ''globalizing'' the classroom actually
   means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose
   of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of
   internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest
   teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of
   teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology
   courses-Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and
   Migration in a Global Context-are used to illustrate how a more
   systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve
   course design.

   careers or graduate school. The first part of this article provides a
   context for the results from the What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree
   in Sociology? study and a summary of its key findings. Wave I data
   demonstrate strong student interest in sociological concepts, perceived
   mastery of some research skills but not others, and general satisfaction
   with the major. Sociology majors are both idealists and careerists. The
   majority expects to enter the job market after graduation but is not
   satisfied with the career advising they receive. Key findings from Wave
   II demonstrate that more respondents go directly into the job market
   than expected, job search strategies are important in finding a job that
   matches what students learned in their sociology programs, and those who
   find such jobs are more satisfied with the major. The second part
   discusses how the survey findings can be used to enhance curriculum,
   advising, and assessment without vocationalizing the curriculum and
   without adding extra burdens to faculty members' already heavy
   schedules. Finally, the article discusses how the data can be used as a
   baseline for department assessment.

AB Although social status plays a crucial role in the generation and
   maintenance of social inequalities, how status processes operate in
   naturalistic social contexts remains less clear. In the following
   article, I provide a case study of doormen-individuals who
   simultaneously represent status experts and status judges-at a highly
   exclusive nightclub to investigate how people draw status distinctions
   in micro-social settings. Using interview and ethnographic data, I
   analyze on what bases doormen evaluate the relative worth of patrons and
   confer the status prize of admission. I find that in making such
   decisions, doormen drew from a constellation of competence and esteem
   cues, which were informed by contextually specific status schemas about
   the relative material, moral, and symbolic worth of particular client
   groups. Moreover, the ways in which doormen used these cues and schema
   depended on the identity of the specific patron being evaluated. As
   such, I argue that processes of interpersonal evaluation and status
   conferral are contextually specific, culturally embedded, and
   interpersonally variable. Despite such variations, a patron's perceived
   social connections seemed to outweigh other types of cues in admissions
   decisions. I conclude by discussing these findings in light of both
   status characteristics theory and Bourdieu's work on the
   transubstantiation of capital to suggest that social capital is a
   powerful status cue that can, under certain conditions, be a more potent
   source of social distinction and status advantage, or hold a greater
   conversion value, in systems of stratification than other types of
   qualities.

AB How do activists create cultural change? Scholars have investigated the
   development and maintenance of collective identities as one avenue for
   cultural change, but to understand how activists foster change beyond
   their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for
   changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look
   at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals
   and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural
   changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with
   animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on
   research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main
   strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as
   well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries
   through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross
   boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study
   contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural
   changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a
   useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and
   maintenance in the sociology of culture.

AB Following up on Zirin's (2008)challenge that sports sociologists "get
   off the bench," and Karen and Washington's (2001) plea to make sports
   sociology more central to analyses of social power, this article
   empirically reviews and assesses the sociology of sports from 1977-2008.
   Using a sample of 441 articles selected from the three major sports
   sociology journals during that period, we conclude that sports sociology
   exhibits a strong and increasing bias toward micro-level analyses of
   (for example) how the content of sports frames and constructs the social
   world. A smaller and shrinking body of work examines more macro-oriented
   issues such as the economics and politics of sports, and there seem to
   be few attempts to meaningfully synthesize these micro and macro
   orientations. We think this partiality toward micro-oriented frameworks
   is rooted in factors unique to sports sociology while also reflecting
   larger trends within sociology as a whole. As advocates of popularly
   accessible public sociology, we respectfully suggest that sports
   sociologists try harder to weave macro analyses into their work, not
   necessarily replacing micro-level approaches, but complementing them. We
   believe that sports sociology is well-positioned to become a standard
   bearer for public sociology, but only if it pays more attention to the
   way organized sports intertwines with the organizational, political, and
   economic forces that perpetuate and exacerbate social inequality.

   targets of religious norms. The second modification theorizes religion's
   linkages to other social institutions as sources of cost and benefit
   that are taken into account by religious entrepreneurs. The third
   modification accounts for status-based discrimination and unequal

AB The diversity of contemporary "capitalisms" underscores the need to
   supplant the amorphous concept of structure with more precise concepts,
   particularly institutions and networks. All institutions entail both
   embodied and relational aspects. Institutions are relational insofar as
   they map obligatory patterns of "getting by and getting
   along"-institutional orders-that steer stable social fields over time.
   Institutions are simultaneously embodied as institutional paradigms,
   part of a larger bodily agency Pierre Bourdieu called habitus.
   Institutions are in turn tightly coupled to networks between various
   people based on, but not reducible to, strategic interests. Yet social
   interaction sometimes exceeds institutional boundaries, giving rise to
   disjunctive fields and underscoring the prominence of institutional
   failures in the unfolding of antagonistic relations such as warfare.
   Such disjunctive fields can be tracked in relation to some transnational
   networks at the global level without assuming developmental convergence.
   This last point underscores the meaning of neoclassical sociology, which
   eschews assumptions of developmental convergence at the global level.

AB If we are to believe the proponents of the Theory of Practice and of
   Rational Choice, the gap between these two paradigmatic approaches
   cannot be bridged. They rely on ontological premises, theories of
   motivations and causal models that stand too far apart. In this article,
   I argue that this theoretical antinomy loses much of its edge when we
   take as objects of sociological investigation processes of historical
   change, that is, when we try to specify in theoretical terms how and in
   which conditions historical actors enact and endorse shifts in patterns
   of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories
   that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in
   light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change:
   first, the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of
   moments of breaks and ruptures. Along the way, I develop an argument
   about the conditions of emergence of self-limiting norms and the
   centrality of epistemic beliefs in situations of high disruption.

AB This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes
   on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council.
   Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses
   demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of
   religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is
   important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood
   only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social
   environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which
   we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests
   and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions'
   legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice
   theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the
   population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold
   firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational
   field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts
   firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.

AB Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory
   expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative
   experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and
   others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these
   opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a
   key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of
   an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We
   connect different strands of theory and research in the social
   psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between
   occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from
   the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are
   consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two
   opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to
   experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's
   macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.

AB Quantitative and computer literacy are increasingly recognized as core
   components of a liberal education in sociology. This study draws on
   student, faculty, and alumni questionnaires to identify the kinds of
   quantitative literacy skills that are perceived to be most critical for
   students enrolled in sociology courses. Respondents at Lehman College
   highlighted the need for proficiencies in a number of key areas,
   including (a) basic mathematical and statistical skills, such as
   measures of central tendency, ratios, and percentages; (b) the
   presentation and interpretation of quantitative data, including tables
   and charts; (c) the research process, such as developing hypotheses,
   sampling, and interpreting data; and (d) computer-based presentation and
   data analysis, including the use of software programs such as SPSS and
   Excel. Moreover, hands-on work in data analysis was highly valued by all
   respondents, particularly as a strategy for mastering these skills. This
   study suggests that effective education in quantitative literacy
   requires both (a) the removal of barriers to the incorporation of data
   analysis in sociology courses and (b) a well-sequenced sociology
   curriculum that pinpoints specific quantitative and computer literacy
   learning objectives at multiple course levels.

AB P>How people respond to questions involving the environment depends
   partly on individual characteristics. Characteristics such as age,
   gender, education, and ideology constitute the well-studied "social
   bases of environmental concern," which have been explained in terms of
   cohort effects or of cognitive and cultural factors related to social
   position. It seems likely that people's environmental views depend not
   only on personal characteristics but also on their social and physical
   environments. This hypothesis has been more difficult to test, however.
   Using data from surveys in 19 rural U.S. counties, we apply
   mixed-effects modeling to investigate simple place effects with respect
   to locally focused environmental views. We find evidence for two kinds
   of place effects. Net of individual characteristics, specific place
   characteristics have the expected effect on related environmental views.
   Local changes are related to attitudes about regulation and growth. For
   example, respondents more often perceive rapid development as a problem,
   and favor environmental rules that restrict development, in rural
   counties with growing populations. Moreover, they favor conserving
   resources for the future rather than using them now to create jobs in
   counties that have low unemployment. After we controlled for county
   growth, unemployment and jobs in resource-based industries, and
   individual social-position and ideological factors, there remains
   significant place-to-place variation in mean levels of environmental
   concern. Even with both kinds of place effects in the models, the
   individual-level predictors of environmental concern follow patterns
   expected from previous research. Concern increases with education among
   Democrats, whereas among Republicans, the relationship is attenuated or
   reversed. The interaction marks reframing of environmental questions as
   political wedge issues, through nominally scientific counterarguments
   aimed at educated, ideologically receptive audiences.

AB A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental
   health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a
   number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women
   have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively
   experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from
   the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and
   persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and
   (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are
   involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data
   from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two
   hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent
   anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss
   the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of
   social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between
   them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future
   theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.

   Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a
   rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from
   the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce
   mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of
   religiosity have a strong impact on giving.

AB Most sociological research assumes that social network composition
   shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not
   adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect
   network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of
   culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this
   article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in
   network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the
   influence of other structural factors, including prior network
   composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little
   evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping
   worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play
   an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the
   dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be

AB In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some
   members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to
   save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely
   together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors-killing
   on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such
   cases-where the same individuals kill and rescue-and discusses their
   relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and
   individualistic theories of killing and rescuing-which explain these
   behaviors with the properties of groups or persons-are inadequate in
   accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995,
   2000)strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell,
   2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals
   during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different
   structures-killing where there is social distance and rescuing where
   there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory
   behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close.
   One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory
   power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme
   variations in individual behavior.

AB There is rarely an introductory text in sociology that does not begin
   with C. Wright Mills's (1967)distinction between personal troubles and
   structural or public issues. To lack sociological imagination is to
   confuse between these two levels of analysis in trying to explain public
   issues in terms of personal troubles, or history in terms of the
   individual's biography. "Troubles occur within the character of the
   individual and within the range of his immediate relations with others;
   Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments
   of the individual and the range of his inner life" (Mills, 1967:8).
   Issues are generated in response to the dynamics of the social system
   and unfold within the larger structural and historical contexts where
   the character of the individual takes shape. Yet, the most popular
   explanation of the contemporary financial crisis with its disastrous
   social and economic consequences is personal greed. It is the greedy
   investment bankers, corrupt politicians, and unscrupulous lobbyists who
   are to take the brunt of the current economic meltdown in the United
   States. A few bad apples on Wall Street have created havoc on Main
   Street. Here, one may argue that greed that-if not kept in check-which
   seems to afflict almost everyone, transcending social class and status
   boundaries, may be a public issue-a structural problem-rather than a
   problem within the character of the individual. Not to be greedy within
   the contemporary social and economic system may be considered
   pathological, an instance of personal trouble.

AB Despite increasing interest in gendered sexuality over the life course,
   a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual
   life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology,
   feminist theory, and sexuality studies, has yet to be elaborated. The
   model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result
   from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and
   disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts,
   within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive
   sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences
   and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine.
   Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de)
   coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps
   explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among
   individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying
   lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests
   improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models,
   and the sexual scripting approach.

   The concept of "emotive performance" is developed to highlight the
   overlooked quality of performativity in the social use of emotion. We
   argue that emotive performance is reflexive, cultural, and
   communicative. As an active social act, emotive performance draws from
   the cultural repertoire of interpretative frameworks and dominant
   narratives. We illustrate the utility of the concept by analyzing two
   episodes of unrehearsed emotive performances by two well-known
   politicians, Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin. The two cases demonstrate how
   emotion can be analyzed as a domain in which culturally specific
   narratives and rhetorics are used to advance the situational agenda of
   actors. The concept opens up a more expansive research agenda for
   sociology. It pushes sociologists to pay greater attention to people's

   conceptualized at the market rather than the firm level because
   excessive pay increases for even relatively few CEOs a year spread to
   other firms through the cognitively and rhetorically constructed
   compensation networks of "peer groups," which are used in the
   benchmarking process to negotiate the compensation of CEOs.
   Counterfactual simulation based on Standard and Poor's ExecuComp data

AB Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical
   work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative
   consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth
   outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have
   documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the
   macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with
   delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among
   adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between
   mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing
   differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for
   delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue.
   Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the
   most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes
   that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem
   behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential
   and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and
   substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both
   observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and
   delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future
   research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the
   mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the
   realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound
   transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the
   international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home,
   the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal
   bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show
   that World War II mobilization played an important role. First,
   Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent
   military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft
   manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing
   intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered
   significantly greater losses where both non-white population and
   aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate
   accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and
   path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years
   left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare
   reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall
   of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we
   demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies
   undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This
   intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an
   inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social
   welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and
   abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.

AB The teaching and learning movement in sociology in general and within
   the American Sociological Association specifically has a surprisingly
   long history. This history can be divided into three periods of
   activity: early efforts (1905 to 1960), innovation and implementation
   (1960 to 1980), and the institutionalization of gains (1980 to 2009).
   Beginning in the first period, sociologists interested in teaching and
   learning focused cycles of attention on the introductory sociology
   course in higher education, high school sociology courses, and the
   formation of sections within the American Sociological Association. Hans
   Mauksch led a period of significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Many of those gains were then institutionalized under the leadership of
   Carla Howery beginning in the 1980s. Publication related to teaching and
   learning, which was once spread throughout numerous outlets has, over
   time, become focused in Teaching Sociology. This article presents an
   investigation of the past and present of the teaching and learning
   movement in sociology and offers some suggested direction for the
   movement's future.

   methodology and the completion of actual research projects. The goal was
   to develop a multilevel team approach within which faculty, graduate
   students, and undergraduates would view their work as part of a
   connected project. The authors describe the three central components of
   the multilevel approach: a newly required research seminar for graduate
   students, an approach to teaching research methods in a joint seminar of
   graduate and undergraduate students, and an approach to teaching
   undergraduate research methods that includes having graduate students
   model research techniques for undergraduates. The authors then assess
   each of these components based on course evaluations and additional data
   gathered from participants. The authors conclude with a series of
   suggestions about how this model might be expanded and developed further
   in their own and other institutional contexts.

   proceeds in four sections. The first section provides an overview of
   service learning and its benefits. This is followed by a detailed
   description of the service-learning project. In the third section, the
   author draws from a postclass survey, course evaluations, and her
   observations to illustrate the ways in which the project enhances

   the sociological imagination. The article concludes with suggestions for
   how the project can be applied in other courses.

   impressions about people with AIDS. Multimethod, active learning
   processes were utilized to introduce the sociological imagination,
   critical thinking, and theory and methods in sociology. The intent was
   to apply basic sociological knowledge to a real-world issue, HIV/AIDS in
   a global perspective. In the process of developing basic skills in
   sociology, a consistent change was noted in students' self-reported
   impressions about people with AIDS in each of four semesters (N = 160).
   Catastrophic contagion characterized their impressions at the beginning
   of the semester; humanizing attributes (encouragement and empowerment)
   replaced catastrophic contagion at the end of the semester. Implications
   of these findings for teaching and learning, and deconstructing HIV/AIDS
   stigma, are discussed.

   the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic

AB P>The effects of highways on transforming human society and promoting
   population change have been investigated in several disciplines,
   including geography, sociology, economics, and planning. Currently, the
   primary highway construction activity in the nation is highway
   expansion; however, this expansion has not been the focus of much of the
   existing literature. This research examines the role that highway
   expansion plays in the process of population change. Specifically, this
   research proposes an integrated spatial regression approach to study the
   impacts of highway expansion on population change in the 1980s and 1990s
   in Wisconsin at the minor civil division level. The integrated approach
   thoroughly considers the factors that influence population change,
   appropriately examines the spatial variations of their impacts,
   simultaneously incorporates spatial lag and spatial error dependence,
   and systematically selects the optimal neighborhood structure. The
   findings suggest that the impacts of highway expansion on population
   change differ across rural, suburban, and urban areas: There are only
   indirect effects in rural areas, both direct and indirect effects in
   suburban areas, and no statistically significant effects in urban areas.
   Overall, highway expansion serves as a facilitator of population change
   within the framework of growth pole theory and location theory.

   re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in

   in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic
   characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with
   the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data,

   may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the

AB The nature of social cognition-how we "know about" the social world-is
   one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we
   know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it.
   Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely,
   what we will call "political ideology"-that is, people's self-placement
   on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We
   focus on that understanding that is in some ways the "ur-form" of social
   cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social
   formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these
   self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the
   development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is,
   when citizens develop such a "political ideology," what does this mean,
   and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their
   subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by
   using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a
   hypothetical policy.

AB Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century
   U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy,
   scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds
   significance for different populations with competing political agendas
   (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of
   community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as
   naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape
   the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute
   sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of
   community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic
   political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and
   around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze
   how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might
   provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first
   explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking
   both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely
   characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary
   sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct
   or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the
   construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of
   class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race.
   Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance
   of these developments.

AB The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational
   sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30
   years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and
   develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths
   become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens
   when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as
   "accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh?
   Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide
   answers and reveal "recoupling'' processes through which institutional
   myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected
   become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling
   accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that
   teachers labeled "turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of
   the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by
   "inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities,
   social interactions, and meaning-making processes.

AB Between 1999 and 2004 only one article appeared in the American
   Sociological Review, the American Journal of Sociology, or Social Forces
   using primary data collected with Web-based research techniques. Since
   then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core
   sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of
   Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in
   many academic fields, especially health research and education;
   Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of
   politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion
   dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing
   surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates,
   increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and
   the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is
   increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative
   data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations,
   Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent
   and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet
   surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data,
   and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of
   participation in stigmatized Internet research and actively engage in
   the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the
   utility and validity of Internet-based data collection.

AB In this article the authors draw attention to the most recent and
   promising developments of sequence analysis. Taking methodological
   developments in life course sociology as the starting point, the authors
   detail the complementary strength in sequence analysis in this field.
   They argue that recent advantages of sequence analysis were developed in
   response to criticism of the original work, particularly optimal
   matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and
   culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods & Research. The
   debate triggered a "second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new
   technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors
   bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected
   advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually
   contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in
   less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling
   the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that "anybody who
   believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to
   social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much
   surprised'' (p. 75).

AB Standards and standardization aim to render the world equivalent across
   cultures, time, and geography. Standards are ubiquitous but
   underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in
   modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works.
   Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse
   theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the
   emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of
   making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple
   outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with
   totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for
   careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences
   of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.

AB This review suggests that the sociology of intellectuals is being
   converted into a sociology of interventions, i.e., instead of focusing
   on a certain social type, it analyzes the movement by which knowledge
   and expertise are mobilized to inform a value-laden intervention in the
   public sphere. We first demonstrate that the classical sociology of
   intellectuals was centered on a problematic of allegiance that no longer
   seems productive. In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular
   social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into
   the public sphere. We then review two literatures that distance
   themselves from the classical problematic and that could be integrated
   under the common rubric of a sociology of interventions: The first
   literature analyzes intellectual fields and markets. It moves away from
   the sociology of intellectuals by multiplying the relevant actors and
   depersonalizing the term "intellectual" so that it no longer stands for
   a social type but for the capacity to make a public intervention, a
   capacity to which many different actors lay claim. The second literature
   analyzes the public deployment of expertise. It multiplies not simply
   the actors laying claim to the mantle of the intellectual, but the
   formats and modes of intervention itself, i.e., the different ways in
   which knowledge and expertise can be inserted into the public sphere.

   decades. While its proponents are well aware of this field's
   contributions and relevance, we focus here on demonstrating its merit to
   the broader sociological community. We do so by addressing the following
   questions: What is music, sociologically speaking? How do individuals
   and groups use music? How is the collective production of music made
   possible? How does music relate to broader social distinctions,
   especially class, race, and gender? Answering these questions reveals
   that music provides an important and engaging purchase on topics that
   are of great concern to sociologists of all stripes-topics that range
   from the microfoundations of interaction to the macro-level dynamics of
   inequality.

AB A burgeoning literature spanning sociologies of culture and social
   network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the
   relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising
   recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison,
   critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques
   for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to
   classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same
   time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as
   providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as
   a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a
   new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis
   that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of
   "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the
   cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly
   permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social
   networks.

AB While much of economic sociology focuses on the stabilizing aspects of
   markets, the social movement perspective emphasizes the role that
   contentiousness plays in bringing institutional change and innovation to
   markets. Markets are inherently political, both because of their ties to
   the regulatory functions of the state and because markets are contested
   by actors who are dissatisfied with market outcomes and who use the
   market as a platform for social change. Research in this area focuses on
   the pathways to market change pursued by social movements, including
   direct challenges to corporations, the institutionalization of systems
   of private regulation, and the creation of new market categories through
   institutional entrepreneurship. Much contentiousness, while initially
   disruptive, works within the market system by producing innovation and
   restraining capitalism from destroying the resources it depends on for
   survival.

AB The inverse relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and
   unhealthy behaviors such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and poor
   nutrition have been well demonstrated empirically but encompass diverse
   underlying causal mechanisms. These mechanisms have special theoretical
   importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities
   in many other components of health, involve something more than the
   ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of
   broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we
   classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet,
   and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that
   specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear
   support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES
   disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies
   that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.

AB Preferences for the racial neighborhood composition differ significantly
   between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of
   Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica,
   CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if
   mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently
   published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social
   distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations
   using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30,
   185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this
   process empirically through a case study of a university housing system
   that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation
   between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the
   larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep
   roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact,
   residence assignment procedures are completely "color-blind." Thus a
   college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of
   preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks
   continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing
   applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to
   halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that
   percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for
   black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist
   preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect
   is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference
   has important consequences for the residential separation process. (C)

   inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status
   hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of
   Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor
   model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on
   perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute
   homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the
   single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This
   allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the
   individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the
   propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four
   waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally
   support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality,
   reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements
   in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Americans and their white counterparts within established designations
   of religious affiliation. Along with control variables, we include
   attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender
   equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual
   relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes
   within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether
   variations emerge and whether they are nested within specific issues,

   they responded by actively reshaping their environment. I apply this
   framework to the Chinese community's initial use of litigation and their

   that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an
   abundance of civic institutions, and civically engaged citizens should
   exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand,
   recent writings exposing a potential "dark side'' of social capital
   suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties.
   Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S.
   counties, the current analysis examines these competing hypotheses
   regarding the effects of civic community. Results suggest mixed support

AB Because lecture-based teaching limits student learning, many instructors
   are interested in pedagogical strategies that support critical thinking,
   student participation, and group discussion in large classrooms.
   Audience response systems, or "clickers," are an emerging tool for
   addressing this problem, but predominant pedagogical models for clicker
   use developed in the natural sciences often do not encourage the
   "inquiry-guided learning" that is useful in sociology. This article
   introduces readers to clicker technology and outlines a new pedagogical
   model for clicker use designed to address sociological learning goals,
   including critical thinking, applications of concepts to real-life
   experiences, and critiques of sociological methods. The authors discuss
   the effects of clickers for classroom interaction and students'
   experiences in three undergraduate sociology courses, using quantitative
   and qualitative data about students' perceptions of the effects of this
   pedagogical model on learning. The results suggest that the model
   positively affects participation, critical thinking, and classroom
   interaction dynamics. The authors conclude with practical suggestions
   for instructors considering implementing clickers; in sociology courses.

AB On the basis of the presumption that the best way to learn something is
   to teach it, the author describes the use of interteaching in
   introductory-level sociology courses. This approach incorporates the
   strong points of several cooperative learning methods, with additional
   features that help ensure the quality of discussion questions and
   encourage students to read course materials more carefully, prior to
   class. The author has found interteaching to be an effective
   organizational and instructional approach for introductory-level
   sociology courses. The method-produces more focused class discussions as
   well as more focused lectures. Moreover, it is an effective way to
   engage students in sociological theory and research.

AB Recently, a growing contingent of "evolutionary sociologists" has begun
   to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from
   evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of
   sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of
   either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers
   and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with
   research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences.
   These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new
   opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's
   relevance to sociology. In this article, the authors review key issues
   pertaining to evolutionary explanations of social behavior, offer
   clarifications and explanations of several issues that are sometimes
   misrepresented and misunderstood, and provide specific suggestions for
   instructors who are interested in updating and improving the quality of
   instruction on this important topic.

AB Historical reversals highlight a basic methodological problem: is it
   possible to treat two successive periods both as independent cases to
   compare for causal analysis and as parts of a single historical
   sequence? I argue that one strategy for doing so, using models of path
   dependency, imposes serious limits on explanation. An alternative model
   which treats successive periods as contrasting solutions for recurrent
   problems offers two advantages. First, it more effectively combines
   analytical comparisons of different periods with narratives of causal
   sequences spanning two or more periods. Second, it better integrates
   scholarly accounts of historical reversals with actors' own narratives
   of the past.

AB This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus
   concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use
   culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent
   findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the
   analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals
   to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this
   conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied
   metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet
   Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors,
   and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the
   group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for
   either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied
   metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social
   bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of
   embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and
   group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be
   more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than
   is modernist culture.

AB With larger percentages of high school students entering higher
   education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes
   occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using
   in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class
   structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I
   argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for
   stratification because it is there that students gain access to social
   and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that
   upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources
   that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate
   their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial
   factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources
   further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings
   contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing
   that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the
   outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources
   throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that
   symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent
   relationship between social and cultural capital.

AB The question of the extent to which Durkheim's argument in Division of
   Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work
   of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In
   this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent
   scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of
   "representation" and "dualism" in Durkheim's overall thought. The
   analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism
   is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is
   based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system.
   Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely
   misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of
   Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in
   order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes
   that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the
   primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of
   "individualism." This necessitates the analytical distinction between
   the two conceptions of " the individual," which I label the
   "bio-psychological" and the "sociological."

AB Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an "impulse" toward sociability,
   defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an
   end in itself. While sociability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates
   a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize
   symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans
   engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from
   ethnomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a
   way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to
   interactions among humans. Beginning with a conceptualization of play as
   an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize
   situated interactions, this article argues that humans can engage in
   playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the
   play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of
   the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies
   how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume
   that interactants share intersubjectivity. The article concludes by
   offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities
   of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and
   other situational factors.

AB Institutional differentiation has been one of the central concerns of
   sociology since the days of Auguste Comte. However, the overarching
   tendency among institutionalists such as Durkheim or Spencer has been to
   treat the process of differentiation from a macro, "outside in"
   perspective. Missing from this analysis is how institutional
   differentiation occurs from the "inside out," or through the efforts and
   struggles of individual and corporate actors. Despite the recent efforts
   of the "new institutionalism" to fill in this gap, a closer look at the
   literature will uncover the fact that (1) it has tended to conflate
   macro-level institutions and meso-level organizations and (2) this has
   led to a taken for granted approach to institutional dynamics. This
   article seeks to develop a general theory of institutional autonomy;
   autonomy is a function of the degree to which specialized corporate
   units are structurally and symbolically independent of other corporate
   units. It is argued herein that the process by which these
   "institutional entrepreneurs" become independent can explain how
   institutions become differentiated from the "inside out." Moreover, this
   article offers five dimensions that can be operationalized, measuring
   the degree to which institutions are autonomous.

AB The notion that social facts can be caused only by other social facts is
   obsolete. Human societies today are affected by biogeochemical change.
   "Developed'' human societies so overuse the finite planet they share
   with "underdeveloped'' societies that the future of all is threatened.
   Medicine's prosthesis concept becomes useful for sociology when extended
   beyond referring to devices for replacing lost body parts or restoring
   impaired sensory powers. If we regard all modern tools and machines as
   prosthetic devices, we see them enabling humans to act as giants-giving
   us colossal resource appetites and huge environmental impacts.
   Prosthetic apparatus (and familiar assumptions) previously useful are
   subject to obsolescence. But there is cultural lag. Conceptual habits
   restrict the way we see our world. The bubble of twentieth century
   experience obstructs our understanding of the future into which we
   giants are plummeting. To explain severe hardships ahead in the
   twenty-first century, sociologists need to break out of our discipline's
   traditional conceptual bubble. Twentieth century expectations have
   become misleading. The basis of past progress (a carrying capacity
   surplus) is gone, replaced by a carrying capacity deficit. Earth's
   diminished carrying capacity will sustain fewer (dinosaur-equivalent)
   Homo colossus than original Homo sapiens.

   author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of
   OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an
   empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and
   sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM
   and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates
   the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational
   sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human
   capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal
   improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its
   computational complexity. These results point to the need for more
   systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.

AB Sociological imagination is a quality of mind that cannot be adopted by
   simply teaching students its discursive assumptions. Rather, it is a
   disposition, in competition with other forms of sensibility, which can
   be acquired only when it is practiced. Adhering to this important
   pedagogical assumption, students were assigned to write their
   sociological autobiography. While in the process of establishing a
   connection between their biography and social history, students were
   encouraged to narrate their life stories using sociological language.
   After completing the project, they were asked to comment on their work.
   Student responses show the positive dimensions involved (including
   unintended therapeutic consequences) and the major hurdles that they
   experienced in executing the assignment. In the latter case, the major
   problem was writing a sociological autobiography qualitatively distinct
   from what might be referred to as "plain autobiography." Results
   reinforce the idea that sociological instruction is better handled when
   sociological imagination is viewed as a linguistic habitus which serves
   both as a medium of communication and an intellectual instrument of
   looking at the social world.

AB Environmental social scientists debate whether or not. modern
   development reduces society's impact on the biosphere. The empirical
   research informing the discussion has not yet adequately examined the
   social determinants of municipal solid-waste (MSW) generation, an
   increasingly relevant issue, both ecologically and sociologically. A
   primary problem for this research concerns the increasing exchange of
   MSW across state and county borders. A convenient way to avoid this
   problem is to examine variation between counties with landfills that
   service only the county in which the landfills are located. I applied
   this restriction to a cross-sectional analysis of total MSW generated in
   Texas at the county level for 2006. Using robust regression, this Study
   found that two basic measures of modern development, Population per
   square mile and per capita income, are both positively related to total
   MSW generated at the county level and together explain about 73 percent
   of the variation in the dependent variable. The evidence corroborates
   the metabolic-rift theory. The concentration of people onto smaller land
   areas, or urbanization, and increasing wealth in a capitalist economy
   contribute to the metabolic rupture between human society and the
   environment.

   countries between 1966 and 2000, this article analyzes patterns of
   membership to the International Human Rights Covenants. The analysis
   produced two main conclusions. First, the potential costs associated
   with joining a treaty, rather than its substantive content, motivates
   the decision to join. Treaties that protect different rights but
   establish comparable implementation mechanisms exhibit similar patterns
   of membership, whereas treaties that protect identical rights but
   establish different implementation provisions exhibit dissimilar
   patterns of membership. Second, rates of treaty membership differ by
   level of commitment. Countries that sign human rights treaties differ
   from countries that ratify. Results are interpreted with respect to four
   theories of commitment and compliance: realism, liberalism,
   constructivism, and sociological institutionalism. Theories that
   emphasize the importance of a treaty's costs (realism and
   institutionalism) fare better than theories that prioritize a treaty's
   content (liberalism and constructivism).

AB How can we understand the social impact of cognitions of a projected
   future, taking into account both the institutional determinants of hopes
   and their personal inventiveness? How can we document the repercussions,
   often contrary to intentions, "back from" such projected futures to the
   production and transformation of social structures? These are some of
   the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to
   look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force
   undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons
   why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological
   theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for
   reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of
   projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future
   projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a
   manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.

AB The author examines the relationship between democracy and international
   trade using post-Soviet countries as a historical example of a
   world-system. World-systems theory and alternative theories are employed
   to create theoretical models of democracy, and pooled time-series
   regression is applied, using an index of democracy as the dependent
   variable and two sets of theoretically distinct control variables. The
   author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and
   democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and
   democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First,
   international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic
   and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to
   conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that
   the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery.
   Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore
   international trade in world-systems and political analysis.

AB Teaching Sociology's emphasis on the scholarship of teaching and
   learning has moved the field well beyond simple description of teaching
   methods. There is no doubt that the journal is more scholarly than in
   the past. Still, we do not take advantage of our rich theoretical
   disciplinary work. There is much to learn sociologically about the
   classroom and other sites of interaction between teachers and students.
   Our classrooms are social sites and our analysis of them can be of help
   to scholars both inside and outside the discipline. In this article, we
   propose a sensitizing concept, the sociology of the college
   classroom-the application of sociological theory and/or concepts to
   understand social phenomena that take place at the level of the
   classroom and other sites of faculty-student interaction. We situate the
   sociology of the college classroom as a subset of the scholarship of
   teaching and learning and the sociology of higher education, Sociology
   of the college classroom can be a place not only where research meets
   teaching, but it can also be a site where sociological theory meets
   pedagogical praxis.

AB This article explores the social-psychological process of identity
   negotiation in collaborative teaching, using Erving Goffman's (1959)
   theoretical tradition of dramaturgy to analyze the classroom itself as a
   performance venue. A dramaturgical analysis of collaborative teaching is
   especially significant given this growing pedagogical trend because
   identity negotiation in team teaching has the potential to impact one's
   teaching, one's career, and students' learning. We demonstrate that
   despite the positive outcomes of collaborative teaching for both
   teachers and learners, building a successful team is a process that
   takes time, effective communication, risk taking, and trust. Most
   significantly, sustaining a clear definition of the situation in the
   classroom is a challenge when a teaching team is engaged in the ongoing
   negotiation of roles, power, and course structure-in front of students.
   We argue that making identity claims in a collaborative team teaching
   situation is both more challenging and rewarding than acting alone on
   the classroom stage.

   Designing a new course for Honors students provided an opportunity to

   students enthusiastically became more self-directed learners. I was
   perplexed with mixed reactions from students; while some joined me and
   adopted the model of teaching and learning I proposed, far more than I
   expected resisted this change. Using a sociological framework helped me
   understand that I had overlooked the powerful influence of the larger
   institutional context for shaping and maintaining expectations for
   teacher/student role enactment. I argue that when students' comfort is
   disrupted and their normative role expectations are rendered
   unpredictable or misunderstood, some respond with resistance. Honors
   students, in particular, may be the most resistant to pedagogical
   innovation because they are the most skilled at, and invested in,
   enacting and maintaining the institutionally normative roles.

PD JUN 2009

AB Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in
   terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories.
   Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences
   in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This
   article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to
   develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant
   hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We
   argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under
   circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that,
   compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare
   participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare
   exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in
   states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using
   individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple
   panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged
   with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine
   immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and
   transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare
   benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire
   account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to
   avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of
   dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment
   discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy
   implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.

AB Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great
   variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality,
   laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex
   behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes
   about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural
   orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual
   attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we
   merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to
   explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality.
   Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and
   Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and
   macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural
   orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a
   greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the
   United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

AB Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that

   performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control
   theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain

   college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different
   instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their
   major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced
   progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental
   ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a
   half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental
   ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly
   support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions

AB White working-class citizens who vote for the Republican Party have been
   fodder for much political discussion and speculation recently, and a
   debate has arisen about the role that "moral values" played in the
   political decision making of this segment of voters. In this article, we
   defend a version of the moral values claim. We show that although the
   Republicans' policies are unpopular, they are bundled with an
   overarching moral framework that is extremely resonant to this set of
   voters, and we use in-depth interviews to uncover this framework. A key
   feature of this framework, on which in the 2004 presidential election
   George W. Bush scored high and John Kerry scored low, is the appropriate
   attitude to wealth, which serves as an indicator for a candidate's
   general moral philosophy and as a heuristic about whether the candidate
   will govern with working-class voters' interests in mind. National
   Election Studies data support the argument that this was a key influence
   on the voting decision in 2004, even controlling for voters' partisan
   identification.

AB Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa
   has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and
   systematically account for the cross-national variation in the
   prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach,
   this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of
   Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that
   legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation
   of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with
   increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand
   repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and
   systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and
   militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate
   that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the
   religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political
   exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of
   economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic
   mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered
   perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.

   participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have
   ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that
   girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack
   interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of
   accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for
   low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying
   Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant
   observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as
   they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their
   participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while
   enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary
   understanding of social construction by illustrating how social

AB This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882
   to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in
   the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation
   between past levels of lynching and current social control practices
   against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of
   social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we
   hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will
   be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930.
   Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three
   outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but
   the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a
   minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable
   black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal
   hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks,
   and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime
   case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup
   conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control,
   and theories that emphasize minority group threat.

   Although a great deal of research reports numerous pedagogical and

   and lack of communication between instructors and organizations. We

   Science Data Analysis Network (SSDAN) has been embedded in the
   undergraduate sociology curriculum at Lehman College, The City
   University of New York (CUNY), since 2003. This study draws on student
   and faculty assessment data from the fall 2004 and spring 2006 semesters
   to evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative. The results show that
   students in courses with an IDA component significantly improved their
   performance on quantitative skills tests. Efforts to engage students in
   active learning through the use of computers were associated with
   increased student comfort and greater interest in working with data. In
   turn, students who were comfortable working with data exhibited
   especially high levels of quantitative skill. Although students who were
   taught a wide variety of data analysis skills reported greater interest
   in working with data, those who were taught a more limited range of
   skills achieved higher performance scores. Likewise, students who were
   required to complete assignments and undertake graded examinations that
   tested a wide range of quantitative skills had less interest in working
   with data but achieved greater improvements in their test scores.

AB Competitions have been a visible and controversial part of the classical
   music world for over a century, yet sociologists have strangely
   neglected to study their social significance. This article explores the
   competition's ongoing contest for legitimacy by considering the case of
   the Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. Through a discourse
   analysis of publicity materials and media coverage, I reconstruct the
   symbolic frameworks that guide the construction of the event and the
   interpretation of competitors' performances. I also trace the critical
   challenge to the idealized representations of the event, and decode the
   gender ideologies implied in commonly used metaphors. Demonstrating the
   centrality of meaning in musical production and reception, I aim to
   expose the limitations of the production perspective and Bourdieu's
   model of the artistic field, offering in their place a new approach
   based on social performance.

AB A pervasive anti-statism often blinds us to the democratic victories in
   the past and thus to possibilities in our future. This article argues
   that big government can democratize society and uses historical
   investigation to make the point. The Study of history emancipates its
   from the tyranny of the present. Progressive social change has come
   about in the United States and elsewhere as combined bottom-up, top-down
   initiatives. I present two such cases of democratization during the New
   Deal era. The first is about rural sociologists' participatory-action
   research with local citizens for policy planning. This program, while
   short-lived, fed into the creation of the field of community
   development. The other is a land-reform experiment among poor African
   Americans. In the 1960s these "resettlement communities" became local
   strongholds of the civil-rights movement, and their descendants carry on
   the Struggle today. I use these two historical instances to show that
   big states as well as social scientists have been effective agents of
   democracy, and suggest that they can be again. History then enable us to
   reimagine, re-new, and re-form our democratic tradition of rural
   sociology.

AB This study proposes a theoretical framework to understand how nations
   deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights
   violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master
   narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on
   studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial
   historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the
   degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two
   key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation
   of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective
   trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war
   Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers'
   speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the
   framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for
   apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification
   of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring
   countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that
   arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial
   conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese
   victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights
   language by proponents of the defensive arguments.

AB The structural theory of ecologically unequal exchange posits that
   through the vertical flow of exports from lower-income countries, the
   stratified world economy enables higher-income countries to
   misappropriate global environmental space. Tied to their unsustainable
   consumption levels, this misappropriation by higher-income countries
   leads to the suppression of resource consumption in lower-income
   countries, well below globally sustainable thresholds, which negatively
   impacts the well-being of domestic populations. To evaluate key aspects
   of the theory, I test the hypothesis that lower-income countries with
   elevated levels of exports sent to higher-income countries exhibit lower
   consumption-based environmental demand, measured as per-capita
   ecological footprints. Findings for generalized least squares panel
   regression analyses of 66 lower-income countries from 1975 to 2000
   confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional
   results indicate that the strength of the hypothesized relationship
   increased in magnitude during the 25-year period. These findings hold,
   net of the effects of economic development, ecological conditions, and
   other structural factors.

AB Contemporary social theory suggests that the meaning of any object
   differs by how we, as social actors, respond and relate to it. The

   In this article, I present data from in-depth interviews with 20
   home-based employees to illustrate how these individuals interact with
   familiar objects in their surroundings to form anchor points for diverse
   lines of conduct. Although I draw from a number of sociological theories
   in my analyses, I further utilize cognitive theory to outline three
   micro-psychological practices (i.e., routinization, goal targeting, and
   emotional alignment) that respondents apply in their attempt to
   establish the desired association between objects and identities. In
   this way, the article both extends previous lines of inquiry into the
   relationship between objects and actors, and makes a new contribution to
   the growing literature on culture and cognition.

PY 2009
AB One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members
   to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This
   article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a
   selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective
   action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn
   diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and
   these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In
   Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status,
   exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and
   received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these
   findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies
   show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual
   an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who
   received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more
   and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the
   allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and
   solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.

AB Sociologists have long recognized that social problems do not derive
   solely from objective conditions but from a process of collective
   definition. At the core of some social issues are framing competitions,
   struggles over the production of ideas and meanings. This article
   examines competing cultural meanings about the fat body. Through frame
   analysis of organizational materials, I map the contested field of
   obesity and document three cultural frames-medical frame, social justice
   frame, and market choice frame-as represented by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association to Advance Fat
   Acceptance (NAAFA), and the food industry group the Center for Consumer
   Freedom (CCF), respectively. Using the "framing matrix," I explore each
   frame's key signature elements and discuss its social and cultural
   significance. Notably, each frame leads to different outcomes for social
   equality and how society thinks about fat bodies, health, and public
   policy.

AB Most pregnant women in the United States today choose a normative

   birth, whether in the hospital or, more rarely, at home. Despite growing
   research on both these paths, a third option chosen by some women has
   rarely been studied: a planned birth at home with neither a doctor nor a
   midwife assisting. In this article, I examine the stories told by women
   in this under-researched population to consider how they make and
   explain this highly unusual choice. Analysis of online birth stories and
   in-depth interviews with women who planned and had an unassisted
   homebirth reveal ways in which these women rely on competing discourses
   of midwifery and medicine to craft a unique sense of agency in birth.

AB Though Pierre Bourdieu has been criticized for ignoring the moral
   dimensions of social judgments, I suggest that his habitus concept can
   provide a useful theoretical foundation for a sociological analysis of
   morality. If the habitus is revised in a way that recognizes the
   embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for
   moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can
   account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social
   settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of
   emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied
   cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are
   employed in different configurations across cultural settings. I argue
   that a modified habitus concept that can account for these phenomena has
   significant implications for the sociological analysis of lay morality.

   sociology, social psychology, urban studies, technology assessment, and
   media studies. The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of
   people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for
   automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and
   can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and
   cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on
   everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone
   calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in
   human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone,
   two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their
   experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats
   to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These
   approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since
   research software for smartphones have been published in open source,
   which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their
   utilization in research.

   I hope the essay demonstrates that working in many fields can make for a
   satisfying and productive career. Research across areas also encourages
   comparative work, and if enough young people become mufti-field
   researchers, sociologists might then develop more interdisciplinary
   skills, which is even now desirable and may one day be necessary for all
   the social sciences. My essay also describes how and why I became

AB Emotional labor refers to the process by which workers are expected to
   manage their feelings in accordance with organizationally defined rules
   and guidelines. Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart introduced this
   concept and inspired an outpouring of research on this topic. This
   article reviews theory and research on emotional labor with a particular
   focus on its contributions to sociological understandings of workers and
   jobs. The sociological literature on emotional labor can be roughly
   divided into two major streams of research. These include studies of
   interactive work and research directly focused on emotions and their
   management by workers. The first uses emotional labor as a vehicle to
   understand the organization, structure, and social relations of service
   jobs, while the second focuses on individuals' efforts to express and
   regulate emotion and the consequences of those efforts. The concept of
   emotional labor has motivated a tremendous amount of research, but it
   has been much less helpful in providing theoretical guidance for or
   integration of the results generated by these bodies of work.

AB During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published
   several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were
   addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black
   Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological
   triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church.
   Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a
   comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African
   American community. He addressed the social construction of African
   American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of
   the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was
   recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational
   studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership
   patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and
   ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church
   membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it
   possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these
   areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the
   discipline's past and a bridge to its future.

   develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this
   process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap
   between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the
   educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5
   percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of
   Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided
   strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and
   the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income
   gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality.
   Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality
   were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor
   force employed in services, and both were lower where greater
   proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing
   industries.

AB Revolutionary advances in telecommunications technology have created a
   ovirtual world.o There are a variety of new social phenomena associated
   with this novel milieu. This represents an excellent opportunity for the
   discipline of sociology to revisit its descriptive roots. This is
   especially true for the sociology of deviant behavior because new forms
   of deviance are clearly related to technological innovations (e.g.,
   Internet crimes against children, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying). The
   current undertaking examines the deviance disavowal strategies of men
   arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped
   police interrogations of 18 subjects, about half of whom were arrested
   in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three
   disavowal strategies seeking to maintain a normal definition of self and
   manage the stigma of their arrest. Directions for future studies in the
   sociology of deviance are suggested.

   and Brian Rich's senior seminar in sociology at Transylvania University.
   The essay concludes with advice for the instructor in pursuit of

   evaluating the literature on Japanese higher education and the
   construction of the Japanese student as a form of Orientalism. As I
   embraced international students' unique, context-specific capacities for
   learning, I relied on the illuminating power of C. Wright Mills's
   sociological imagination to heighten their understandings of themselves
   and others. Despite the characterization of Japanese students as passive
   learners, I discovered an engaged and responsive student body who
   developed a keen sociological imagination through storytelling.
   Employing a pedagogy of storytelling, I helped my students successfully
   explore gender and ethnic troubles as public issues in a global context.
   The insight gained abroad has led me to expand my pedagogy at home

AB C. Wright Mills would be a friendly critic of service learning,
   acknowledging its benefits for providing students with experiential
   learning opportunities to connect personal troubles with social issues.
   Yet he would be critical of service-learning practices that perpetuate
   institutional power inequalities and that do not advance the social
   change objectives of community-based organizations. We offer an
   innovative approach that helps to address some of these concerns which,
   when used in conjunction with "best practices" of service learning, has
   the potential to make a greater impact on the community than most
   service-learning projects. This paper highlights how two sociology
   programs in two urban universities-a large, elite university and a
   smaller, minority-serving university-have completed significant
   community-based research projects by having classes of students at both
   universities work on projects both consecutively and simultaneously
   across several semesters to complete substantial research projects with
   and for community partners. We use a case study approach to identify
   five key practices that have enabled the two universities to effectively
   collaborate across institutions,

AB Though C. Wright Mills made a pivotal contribution to the discipline by
   raising sociologists' awareness of the ideological and bureaucratic
   content of sociological practicality, he may have placed unyielding
   limits on "the promise" he profoundly proclaimed in the "sociological
   imagination." By defining types of practicality in such rigidly
   confining terms, as either "liberal" or "illiberal" those wishing to
   practice sociology in broader and more expansive ways were left with few
   of the alternatives Mills himself wished to extol. Over the past
   generation, the field of applied sociology and teaching and learning
   sociological practice have struggled to develop in the discipline. This
   has posed huge challenges for teachers wishing to address the needs of
   students who have perennially been interested in finding practical
   possibilities for applying their sociology in jobs and careers. The
   purpose of this paper is to: 1) examine the concept of sociological
   practicality propounded by Mills; 2) critically assess the concept of
   sociological practicality in the historical context of American
   sociology, 3) identify and discuss a broad typology of models of
   research and practice from which types of practicality may emerge; 4)
   discuss the implications of this typology for teaching and learning

AB Sociologists empirically and theoretically neglect genocide. In this

   on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and
   dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative
   dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes
   that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We
   investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of
   refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the
   Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process.
   Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African
   settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a
   collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which
   amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and
   lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial
   and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the
   instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive
   perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing
   perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously
   added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering
   discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin

AB The writings of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) foreshadowed several
   of the dominant theories of sociology, social psychology, aesthetics,
   linguistics and literary theory. His ideas impacted generations of
   thinkers, but today he is uncelebrated, mostly unknown. His writings on
   populism, expressionism, and pluralism are relevant to contemporary
   sociology, especially community sociology. Here we consider his views on
   the nature and meaning of community, and his methods Of Studying and
   interpreting communities. These include an emphasis on the essential
   particularity of human communities and their connection to wider systems
   and networks. Herder urges special attention to the elements of context
   (place, time, language, culture) within which communi ties are situated.
   Herder's is an embedded particularism, a focus on individuality and
   diversity within larger unities. He also sensitizes LIS to the
   multivalence and multiplicity of social phenomena. As the proper stance
   for community research he Counsels involvement and empathy rather than
   objectivity and emotional distance, and he urges researchers to be
   sensitive to data from all of their senses, not merely sight. Drawing
   upon Herder's writings, we conclude with several important
   methodological principles relevant to improving current work on the
   nature and conceptualization of communities.

   reveals export commodity concentration has a negative effect on level of
   ecological footprint demand net the strong positive influence of income

AB In the United States, voter turnout rates have been declining for the
   last 4 decades; however, this pattern differs substantially by region.
   Southern states have actually seen a fairly dramatic increase in turnout
   since the 1950s and currently the South and non-South have almost
   identical rates of voter registration and turnout. Using a series of
   Heckman probit models, which examine voting as a two-step process of
   registering and casting a vote, we systematically investigate
   differences in rates of registering and voting across regions and test
   explanations for regional convergence over time. Using data from the
   American National Election Studies (1956-2000), we find that regional
   convergence in voter registration is primarily due to the removal of
   formal and informal barriers to registration and voting in the South and
   declining efforts to mobilize potential voters in the non-South. In
   addition, we find some fairly distinct differences in which predictors
   are important to each stage of the voting process; for example, race is
   a better predictor of registering to vote than voting. We conclude with
   a discussion of the implications of these results.

AB Austin Turk (1969) offers a distinctly sociological explanation of
   policing by theorizing that structural reinforcers (e.g., older police
   officer, younger citizen) and reversals (e.g., younger police officer,
   older citizen) of the situationally absolute positional authority of
   police officers affect the relationship between police officers and
   citizens. To this point, however, there have been only three direct
   tests of Turk's theory (Greenleaf and Lanza-Kaduce, 1995; Lanza-Kaduce
   and Greenleaf, 2000; Weidner and Terrill, 2005). All have examined overt
   conflict and the results are mixed. The present research therefore adds
   a fourth test of Turk's (1969) theory to the sociological literature by
   examining the effects of structural reinforcers and reversals on
   citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy and propriety of police actions
   during routine traffic stop encounters. Net of control measures,
   including the legal reason for the traffic stop, and extra-legal
   measures, such as driver gender, the data provide modest to strong
   support for parts of Turk's (1969) theory and absolutely no support for
   others. The conclusion of the present study is that more research is
   needed to determine whether Turk (1969) is correct in theorizing that
   there is a sociology, and not just a social psychology, to
   police-citizen encounters.

   conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation,
   and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are
   considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its

   protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype
   in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to
   be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having
   sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive
   ability. The genetics-informed sociological analysis here suggests that

   had both progressive and reactionary responses to the anti-imperialist
   struggles of their era. Particular emphasis is given to how issues of
   race, class, and gender were interwoven in their discourses on
   imperialism.
   The second section focuses on how the writings of the most famous woman
   theorist and critic of imperialism during this era-Rosa Luxemburg-are
   virtually ignored in U. S. portrayals of feminist sociology and women
   founders of sociology. To address this omission, Luxemburg's theory of
   imperialism is examined, as well as how it has influenced contemporary

AB Critical thinking is often presented as a generic technique. This

   sociological perspective. I suggest three answers to the above question:
   that the sociological perspective is critical for comprehending complex
   issues, that all sociology is implicitly critical by virtue of its
   debunking tendency, and that some sociology is explicitly critical by
   virtue of value commitments that lead to a critique of domination. The
   article identifies some basic themes of what it means to think
   sociologically, discusses sociology's "double critique" in more detail,
   illustrates the critical potential of scientific, humanistic and
   critical approaches to sociology, and explores some implications of this
   approach for how we teach sociology. It concludes by suggesting that the
   goal of fostering critical thinking in our students might better be met
   by returning to the critical roots of our own discipline.

   Internet videoconferencing did not affect exam scores or attendance.
   However, it substantially lowered student evaluation scores. In
   comparison to classroom-based instruction and due to problems with and
   limitations of the technology, students experienced greater difficulty
   communicating with the instructor, felt more separated, and were less
   engaged in the course. Therefore, they perceived the instructor's
   teaching to be less effective, and evaluations reflected lower scores,
   thereby "punishing" the instructor. Symbolic interactionism is used to
   interpret the results. This research is compared and contrasted with a
   previous study conducted by one of the authors (Koeber 2005), also
   published in Teaching Sociology, which yielded opposite results. In
   Koeber's study the instructor was rewarded with favorable student
   evaluations for the use of new technology that enhanced engagement. We
   conclude that when instructors choose whether or not to use Internet
   videoconferencing, they must weigh the potential benefits associated
   with bridging distance gaps versus potential costs associated with
   reduction in quantity and quality of symbolic interaction that may cause
   students to disengage.

AB Although a central construct for sociologists, the concept of
   institution continues to elude clear and full specification. One reason
   for this lack of clarity is that about 50 years ago empirical
   researchers in the field of sociology turned their gaze downward, away
   from macro-sociological constructs in order to focus their attention on
   middle-range empirical projects. It took almost 20 years for the concept
   of the institution to work its back onto the empirical research agenda
   of mainstream sociologists. The new institutional project in
   organizational sociology led the way. Since then, scholars in this
   tradition have achieved a great deal but there is still much more to
   accomplish. Here, future directions for research are considered by
   reviewing how the concept of the institution has come to be treated by
   mainstream philosophers, sociologists of science and technology studies,
   and social network theorists.

   sociology of technology is reviewed as another route into dealing with
   technology and materiality. The recent ideas in sociology of technology

   confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in
   assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the

AB Legislative roll-call voting is crucial in policy making. Standard
   approaches to studying roll-call voting focus on legislator attributes,
   ignoring how social factors, such as legislator relations, may drive
   voting. Using original data based on a state legislature, I adopt a
   relational approach to examine how legislator relations impact roll-call
   voting net of attributes. Results show that relations strongly influence
   voting, adding significantly to the explanatory power of the models.
   These results imply that standard approaches to studying roll-call
   voting should incorporate consideration of social factors, suggesting
   the value of social influence models in studies of political phenomena.

AB In this article I first examine the ways in which the dual terms of
   structure and agency are used in sociological theories. Then, relying on
   Lacan's notions of split-subject, the formula of sexuation, and forms of
   discourses, and Laclau's theory of ideological hegemony, I argue that
   agency in most current sociological formulations is but a posited other
   of the structure that dissolves if examined closely; it is similar to
   the Lacanian fantasmic object. To resolve the fundamental paradoxes in
   structure-agency theories, I reformulate structures as paradoxical,
   incomplete, and contingent symbolic formations that are always partial
   and unstable due to their inclusion and exclusion operations.
   Consequently, social transformational agency consists in the structural
   inconsistencies that open structural gaps available to social actors. As
   a result, agency can be recognized in two moments conceived as two
   symbolic gestures. From this perspective, agency as such is always a
   possibility qua potential and its efficacy is always retroactively
   recognized-actualized from within a new social structure or symbolic
   order.

AB Using the American Housing Survey for 2001 and Census 2000, I examine
   the link between gated communities and residential segregation. I
   hypothesize that gating and segregation are defined by similar
   mechanisms, thus reinforcing urban inequality in U. S. cities. The
   results, however, indicate a more complex relationship. On the one hand,
   there are common mechanisms behind the two processes: the pursuit of
   higher property values, fear of crime, and fear of increased social
   heterogeneity. An increase in percent recent immigrants leads to higher
   levels of both segregation and gating. On the other hand, factors such
   as region, percent black, percent Hispanic, percent college graduates,
   and functional specialization affect the two processes differentially.
   Although segregation is less pronounced and declining in the U. S. urban
   Southwest, gated communities are much more prominent there. The results
   challenge the notion that the declines in residential segregation in
   recent decades indicate social progress.

AB The cultural turn has been one of the major shifts in sociology over the
   last two decades. Though nearly everyone now agrees that culture
   matters, how it matters is not terribly clear. What, exactly, is culture
   supposed to do? In this essay, I articulate two ideal-typical - though
   often implicit - ways most sociologists have thought about culture's
   role in action. Although no single sociologist or piece of research
   fully embodies either ideal type, I believe they are real tendencies in
   the field that have real consequences for how research is designed,
   undertaken, and understood. After outlining these approaches, I subject
   them to an engagement with cognitive science. This is not out a desire
   for reductionism but, as I will show, because a crucial difference
   between these perspectives is their implicit model of how human beings
   perceive, acquire, store, retrieve, and act on the symbolic information
   that surrounds them every day. This exercise will lead to the conclusion
   that both perspectives are incomplete and will point toward a synthetic
   approach that can shed new light on how culture matters for action.

AB This article develops a global fields approach for conceptualizing the

   of Bourdieu and organizational sociology. It highlights particular
   structural configurations ("spaces of relations") and the specific
   cultural content ("rules of the game" and "symbolic capital") of global
   systems. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through an analysis
   of the different forms of the two hegemonic empires of the past
   centuries, Great Britain and the United States. The British state tended
   toward formal imperialism in the 19th century, characterized by direct
   territorial rule, while the United States since WWII has tended toward
   informal imperialism. The essay shows that the difference can be best
   explained by considering the different historical global fields in which
   the two empires operated.

AB Approaching the public representation of a "difficult past" as a

   government has represented the country to international audiences via
   tourism after the wars of Yugoslav secession. Challenging assumptions
   that contentious historical moments will be commemorated, I find that
   the state has managed Croatia "diflicult" recent past through covering
   and cultural reframing rather than public acknowledgment. The country
   has omitted the war from representations of national history and
   repositioned Croatia as identical in history and culture to its Western
   European neighbors. I draw from Goffman's work on stigma to explain the
   Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for
   understanding the conditions under which public recognition of
   reputation-damaging events is likely not to occur I conclude by
   discussing theoretical implications for scholarship on collective
   memory, cultural sociology, and world polity theory.

   for evidence of publication bias. The effect of the .05 significance
   level on the pattern of published findings is examined using a
   "caliper'' test, and the hypothesis of no publication bias can be
   rejected at approximately the 1 in 10 million level. Findings suggest
   that some of the results reported in leading sociology journals may be
   misleading and inaccurate due to publication bias. Some reasons for
   publication bias and proposed reforms to reduce its impact on research
   are also discussed.

AB Elite college admissions exemplify processes of social closure in which
   status-group conflict, organizational self-interest, the strategic use
   of cultural ideals of merit, and broader social trends and contingent
   historical events interweave to shape institutional power in the United
   States. The Chosen, Jerome Karabel's monumental study of the history of
   college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton from 1900 to 2005,
   offers a political sociology of elite recruitment and a cultural and
   social history of the definition of merit that has guided these three
   schools and shaped much current thinking about college admissions. As
   Max Weber reminded us, the very definition of cultural ideals of an
   epoch bear the stamp of elite group domination: not cultural ideals but
   cultural interests and their strategic uses guide institutional power.
   The book provides an impressive empirical demonstration of that
   proposition: it identifies four different definitions of merit as
   organizational gatekeeping tools that have guided Harvard, Yale, and
   Princeton over the last hundred years and shows how these definitions
   were molded by status-group conflict and organizational interests. This
   essay outlines the central arguments of Karabel's book; it identifies
   key contributions for our understanding of the history, culture,
   organizational interests, and politics of these three institutions; it
   highlights the social closure framework guiding the analysis; and it
   reflects on a fundamental ambiguity in Karabel's thinking about
   meritocratic ideals as governing principles for modern stratified
   societies.

AB In his massively influential work, Clifford Geertz crystallized core
   methodological and theoretical elements of a strong program in cultural
   sociology, a program that argues for a meaning-centered social science.
   If meaning is to be so central, then the theoretical tools that the
   humanities have developed to investigate art and language must become
   central to the human sciences more generally. The 'thick descriptions'
   Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the
   empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local
   knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing,
   global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not
   enriched but different as it emerges locally. Interests can never be
   objective, and extra-individual structures are both cultural and social
   at the same time. Yet, while structures are central, they take form only
   through contingent process, and intertwining them is what Geertz's turn
   to performance was about.

   and influential piece of work. Why? Using resources from the Russian
   formalism of the early 20th century, the article uncovers the textual
   and structural foundations that gave it a competitive advantage over his
   other writings. In so doing the analysis seeks to reconcile Geertz with
   the structuralism that he famously and perhaps unwisely dismissed as
   irrelevant for interpretative sociology. The reception trajectory of
   Geertz points to the need for a more robust theory of culture than his
   hermeneutics could offer. The Yale strong program is understood as a
   solution to this malaise, one that combines structuralist analysis with
   Geertzian sensibilities.

AB The strong program in cultural sociology faces - and creates for
   sociology generally - an epistemic dilemma: does an interpretation of
   culture constitute an explanation of social action? The work of Clifford
   Geertz suggests the two are not mutually exclusive. In his empirical
   studies he artfully produced 'maximal interpretations' that went beyond
   both extant theories and the immediate data given by participant
   observation. Maximal interpretations, I argue, claim the epistemic
   status of sociological explanations. Indeed, the core problems of the
   philosophy of social science and social theory can be reframed in terms
   of the difference between relatively uncontroversial 'minimal
   interpretation' and relatively tendentious (but powerful) 'maximal
   interpretation'. The implications of this distinction for research can
   be made clear by considering, as an example, what is required to explain
   witch hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, and the Salem
   witch trials in particular.

   have shaped the discipline of sociology and continue to shape it. It is
   organized around the concept of crisis, arguing that sociology has been
   produced by crises and that it has been defined by its responses to
   crises. It identifies an ethic of control and manipulation as a chief
   product of 19th century responses. It suggests that we have once again
   entered a period of disruption and rapid change, and that the current
   challenge of sociology is to situate ourselves, reflexively, within a
   dense web of philosophical, psychological, social, biological, and
   environmental linkages, recognizing that we can never see the network in
   its entirety because we ourselves are nodes within it. However, the
   ethic of control and manipulation that we have inherited from earlier
   sociological responses often prevents sociologists from developing an
   immanent, reflexive, and ecological approach to the crisis of the
   present that would enable us to place ourselves within this web.

AB In this article / explore the ethical terrain of experiential learning
   activities drawing on my experiences leading college students on field
   trips into criminal justice settings. Though there are numerous
   educational benefits to adopting experiential learning activities, the
   rewards must be evaluated in light of the potential harms to nonstudent
   participants. Student observations of criminal justice settings can
   reinforce common stereotypes of prisoners as scary and dangerous while
   reifying the legitimacy of state power exercised through agents of
   social control, More broadly, experiential learning activities can also
   highlight the shame and embarrassment of subordinate groups when such
   activities devolve into voyeuristic spectacles of human misery. In light
   of these potential harms to nonstudent groups, this article proposes
   guiding questions for educators to address in designing experiential
   activities. These questions draw attention to the following issues: the
   vulnerability of participants, the relative social power of nonstudent
   participants, whether participation is truly voluntary, the
   accessibility of the setting to outside observers, group size, benefits
   to nonstudent participants, duration of activity, protection of
   confidentiality, the role of students in the activity, and the
   curricular focus of the experience.

AB We have updated Ferree and Hall's (1990) study of the way gender and
   race are constructed through pictures in introductory sociology
   textbooks. Ferree and Hall looked at 33 textbooks published between 1982
   and 1988. We replicated their study by examining 3,085 illustrations in
   a sample of 27 textbooks, most of which were published between 2002 and
   2006. We found important areas of progress in the presentation of both
   gender and race as well as significant areas of stasis. The face of
   society we found depicted in contemporary textbooks was distinctly less
   likely to be that of a white man, very prominent in the 1980s texts, and
   much more likely to be that of a minority woman. Thus, while only 34
   percent of the pictures of identifiable individuals in the textbooks
   examined by Ferree and Hall were of women, almost 50 percent of such
   pictures were of women in the recent texts. Moreover, while the
   percentage of white men portrayed dropped from about 45 percent to 30
   percent, the percentage of portrayals of minority women rose from about
   11 percent to 22 percent. Another sign of progress has been the
   decreasing likelihood of textbooks to depict race and gender as being
   nonoverlapping categories: while women of color apparently "had" only
   race in the sample examined by Ferree and Hall, they "had" both gender
   and race in the sample we studied. Still, our examination of pictures as
   a whole as a unit of analysis found that blacks continue to be more
   likely than any other racial group to be depicted in the presence of
   other racial groups and thus, to idealize the degree of social
   integration in American society. We also still see non-white women
   enjoying very little (in fact, no) visibility in sections devoted to
   theory, despite developments in feminist theory, generally, and
   multicultural feminist, specifically. In general, though, our analysis
   suggests that the various criticisms of introductory texts that have
   appeared in this forum and others can have an impact on the content of
   those texts and, by extension, the sociology we teach.

AB In this paper, we argue that novels, mysteries and nonfiction books can
   provide undergraduate students with an accessible and exciting place to
   explore sociological concepts. Using storytelling as a pedagogical tool,
   we teach students key theoretical ideas by analyzing the books in their
   specific sociocultural contexts. First, we put forward three different
   strategies for using nontraditional readings in the classroom. We then
   present standardized assessment data to measure how well these
   strategies helped to meet our student learning goals: increasing
   engagement, enhancing conceptual understanding and improving analytic
   ability. We also discuss what we consider to be the pedagogical costs
   and benefits of using these approaches in the classroom.

AB The sociology of knowledge, derived from research on the hard sciences,
   overlooks the potential for outsiders to determine the content of
   knowledge within professional disciplines. Using the case of the Sally
   Hemings affair, I introduce the concept of "knowledge advocacy" to
   analyze how outside groups shape historical knowledge. The Hemings
   controversy involved not only historical evidence, but also the
   understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against
   the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates
   successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of "objectivity as
   neutrality" eventually embracing "objectivity as the scientific method"
   in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic
   interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in
   knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the
   potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity
   is compromised.

AB Sociologists of religion have often connected secularization to science,
   but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists
   or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address
   this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite
   academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005.
   Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university
   scientists as well as a change in their religious composition.
   Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to
   natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred
   between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion
   of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists.
   Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general
   population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact
   among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise
   older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists.
   Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master
   identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of
   religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion
   that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and
   connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional
   spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership
   role in society.

   sociological study, as an object of research, as a factor in behavior,
   and as an element to be controlled in the prosecution of research''
   (Williams, 1958: 621). In this essay, I ask what has become of that

   distinct trajectories of sociological research on values, briefly
   describing the contributions of each, and identifying several lines of

AB Drawing inspiration from the work of Robin M. Williams Jr., I map out
   the complexities of ethnic and racial relations in the contemporary
   United States by focusing on the impacts of 9/11 - particularly in
   relation to immigration policy. Because the attackers entered the
   country through regular immigration channels (i.e., as foreign students)
   the U. S. government has introduced policies to enhance border security,
   restrict immigration, increase the surveillance of immigrant
   populations, and more actively enforce immigration policy. These
   national-security-related immigration policies, however, are
   exacerbating existing tensions and producing new sets of ethnic and
   racialized conflicts in the United States. In this article, I first
   provide an overview of the key national-security-related immigration
   policies that were passed in the wake of September 11, 2001. Then, I
   review some of the recent sociological literature, as well as draw from
   my own preliminary research in the State of New Jersey, to illustrate
   the social impacts of these policies on ethnic and racial relations. I
   conclude with an outline of the ways the sociology of ethnic and racial
   relations specifically, as well as other subfields of the discipline,
   might approach analyses of social conflict in the contemporary United
   States, post - September 11.

   a variant of Dillman's "total designmethod," the author conducted a
   survey of 345 arts and sciences academic deans, asking them to select
   the top-ranked and second-ranked disciplines on a number of items.
   Sociology fared quite well or well on commitment and concern with
   students, success in conducting research aimed at ameliorating community
   problems, ability to work in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
   teams, involvement in college and university governance, and involvement
   in the surrounding community. Sociology did not fare well on academic
   rigor, success in attracting students to the discipline, success of
   students with regard to occupational and graduate education achievement,
   securing funded grants and contracts, success in producing peer-reviewed
   publications, involvement in international activities, fundraising, and
   overall prestige on campus. The author offers suggestions on how
   sociology could improve its status in the academy.

AB Nearly all of sociology's top graduate training programs require their

   This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices
   of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with
   particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory
   construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the
   discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of
   questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were
   teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of
   the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the
   nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most
   important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However,
   attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical
   theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific
   standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author
   explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices.

AB 'Theory' is one of the most important words in the lexicon of
   contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite
   unclear what sociologists mean by the words 'theory,' 'theoretical,' and
   'theorize.' I argue that confusions about the meaning of 'theory' have
   brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and
   even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions:
   (a) what does 'theory' mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what
   ought 'theory' to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five
   stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about
   'theory.' Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of
   the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some
   difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology
   to. Fourth, I articulate the question, 'what ought "theory" to mean?,'
   which I dub the 'semantic predicament' (SP), and I consider what one can
   learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a
   'semantic therapy' for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP:
   (a) the principle of practical reason-SP is to a large extent a
   political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political
   mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological
   pluralism-the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and
   epistemologically demanding.

   statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE
   both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4)
   relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained
   APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability,
   hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a
   criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC
   analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE

   emerged. While not absolutely in sync, there is a striking overlap
   across three of the most visible of these: Boyer's Scholarship
   Reconsidered, Carnegie's Stewardship of the Discipline, and Burawoy's
   Public Sociology. Putting the development of these conceptualizations
   into the larger context of shifts in higher education, I briefly review
   each, putting special emphasis on the synergy among them. However,
   despite these overarching guides and a number of other noted innovations
   (particularly in the scholarship of teaching and learning), new
   challenges have arisen, I end by discussing these new developments,
   drawing from basic sociological research to provide insights for
   maintaining gains and pushing these efforts forward. In particular, SoTL
   and the aging of the cohort of leaders who pioneered these redefinition
   efforts emphasize the importance of Preparing Future Faculty (PFF)
   programs, and the placement of new PhDs with this broad vision in
   PhD-granting departments, as well as in liberal arts colleges and

   strategies to those of other teachers and the recommendations in

   considerably more likely than other sociologists to engage students in

   The results demonstrate that religion affects wealth indirectly through

   The results also provide evidence of a direct effect of religion on

AB We use a reputational approach to create a theory of martyrdom that
   synthesizes scholarship on the body politic, cultural symbols, and
   collective memory. The making of a martyr, a contested social process,
   depends on both the resources of the martyr's supporters and the
   cultural context into which the martyr's image is introduced. Our
   approach is well suited to analyzing how martyrs are used 'on the
   ground' and given cultural and material utility. We highlight the
   attention paid to the conception and reception of the martyr's corporeal
   body, in particular, as a source of identity and meaning, giving
   emotional weight to social ideas about death and sacrifice. Control over
   martyrs' bodies derives from the cultural and political intricacies of
   reputational entrepreneurship, thus employing the body as a medium of
   culture. To examine this concept of embodied martyrdom, we examine the

   that have contributed to these concerns, including both "external"
   factors that are largely beyond the organizational reach of RSS and
   "internal" factors that are more directly linked to organizational
   characteristics and actions. Drawing upon the distinctions between "red

   alternatives that, if pursued, could help to create an expanded set of

AB Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge
   from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions
   produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A
   work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers
   that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get
   from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained.
   The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings
   reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance
   feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to
   feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations.
   These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest
   that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on
   emotions.

AB Many analysts of civil society argue that the path from activity in

   mediated-membership leads to unintentional political socialization
   through discussion and/or cognitive engagement, which then leads to
   participation. Others, however, have noted that groups are often
   effective in the direct mobilization of their members. This article
   tests these competing claims, while also considering the extent to which
   the mediation process relies on negative social capital (targeted
   requests for activity). Employing a series of structural equation
   models, I find strong support for the mediation argument, as well as for

AB Drawing on recent advances in community-ecological research, emerging
   scholarship within family sociology on the importance of men, and
   current research on gender stratification, this article lays out a
   theoretical framework and offers evidence of the importance of two forms
   of male capital, men in families and old heads, for lessening female and
   male violence rates across communities. Using arrest and ecological data
   from more than 1,600 counties and seemingly unrelated regression
   techniques, the author finds that the presence of men in families is
   integral to community efforts to reduce both female and male violence
   levels, net controls for ecological variables; old heads are moderately
   effective in reducing male violence levels. Men in families have robust
   effects on both female and male violence rates, though male homicide is
   somewhat more responsive to shifts in the presence of men in families
   and old heads. Gender differences across other ecological variables are
   minimal.

AB This study advances the sociological inquiry on social categories by
   synthesizing two lines of research in economic and organizational
   sociology - studies of industrial categories in market dynamics and
   neo-institutional analyses of social categories. It compares the
   classificatory schemes and structures in the California and French wine
   industries and investigates the impact of institutionalized categories
   on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price.
   Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems,
   similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and
   affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound
   consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in
   classification systems. They also enrich the institutional analyses by
   demonstrating that institutional categories systematically differentiate
   market products and create social differences and hierarchies.

AB Donald Black insists that sociology must be purged of its psychological
   elements in order to become a genuinely distinct and scientific
   discipline. But such "purification" is simultaneously unnecessary,
   undesirable, and unattainable. It is unnecessary because the scientific
   shortcomings of sociology are indigenous and have nothing to do with
   psychologism. Indeed, a more scientific sociology would look more, not
   less, like psychology. Purity is undesirable in that it is not only not
   a scientific virtue, but is antithetical to the very scientific values
   that Black invokes to justify it. His systems are neither theories nor
   laws, but heuristics, more akin to common sense than to scientific
   theory. Finally, purity is unattainable because though society is indeed
   discontinuous with the individuals who make it up, it and all theorizing
   about it, are ontologically and conceptually dependent upon them.

   theory: that the form of the theory precludes testing by correlational

   that elite, corpulent athletes might enact through their mere presence,
   as well as through their public ability to compete with idealized
   athletic bodies. That sport and dominant beliefs about sport contribute
   to disciplining bodies is not a point of contention for us. It is,
   however, unclear where the disciplining lines are drawn, and what
   happens when bodies that resist corporeal rationality refuse to
   disappear. What are the consequences of/for publicly successful,
   undisciplined bodies operating instead in a corporeal irrationality? Of
   course this entire line of questioning suggests fissures in the

   are increasingly employed in American sociology, it is rare to find all
   three of Bourdieu's master concepts-habitus, capital, and
   field-incorporated into a single study. Moreover, these concepts are
   seldom deployed within a relational perspective that was fundamental to
   Bourdieu's thinking. The article "Bourdieu and Organizational Analysis"
   by Mustafa Emirbayer and Victoria Johnson is a welcomed exception, for
   it draws on all three of Bourdieu's pillar concepts to propose a
   relational approach to the study of organizations. It both reframes
   existing thinking about organizations, particularly from the
   neo-institutional and resource dependence schools, and indicates new
   directions for research in organizations to move. This paper evaluates
   their contribution calling attention to its many strengths and
   suggesting a few points that need future clarification and elaboration.

AB Adolescent substance use is an important area of research in sociology;
   however, there is a lack of research on nonmedical prescription drug
   use. The dearth of research on this topic is problematic given the
   relatively high prevalence of use among adolescents, the drastic
   increase in use in recent years, and the potential negative consequences
   from misusing prescription drugs. Using data from a national sample of
   adolescents, this research fills an important gap in the literature by
   testing one of the most prominent theories of deviance: social learning
   theory. Findings support variables related to social learning theory as
   correlates of nonmedical prescription drug use. Adolescents with
   definitions that are pro-substance use, whose peers use drugs, and whose
   parents and peers have attitudes that condone substance use are more
   likely to report nonmedical prescription drug use in the past year.
   Important implications and future research directions are discussed.

   project uses wage and sex composition data that allows students to learn
   actively how data are used to study general trends and changes over
   time. It encourages students to explore the reality of their possible
   careers and fields in terms of wages, proportion of women and men, and
   other factors. Sharon Bird's class exercise requires students to
   consider the interactional dynamics of everyday work life and encourages
   them to see the subtle processes of marginalization and exclusion while
   also thinking about how to overcome gender biases. Some of this
   information will contribute to student angst about inequality in the
   workplace; thus, we conclude with suggestions for decreasing potential
   student distress and increasing student empowerment.

AB Driven by the popularity of social capital theories, the concept of

   this area relies on exclusively "structural" thinking, attributing group
   identification to mechanisms such as the arrangement of physical space,
   power relations, or high investment requirements. Often neglected is a
   strand of theory that attributes gemeinschaft to shared moral order and
   culture. Using data from the Urban Communes Project, this article
   directly tests the influence of both structural and cultural mechanisms
   in producing the experience of community. Although the results show that
   both structural and cultural mechanisms are positively correlated with
   gemeinschaft, they also confirm the existence of shared moral order as
   the most likely proximate mechanism for creating community in these
   groups. Analyses using fuzzy-set techniques illustrate how culture and
   structure combine to sustain-or inhibit-the experience of community.

   approaches to ethnicity that follow the "cognitive turn," as well as
   recent studies of human-anitnal interaction and cultural examinations of
   nature and the environment, this article demonstrates how: (1) these men
   frame their animal practices within their understandings of ethnicity,
   culture, and territory; and (2) communal relationships formed through
   pigeon caretaking reinforce definitions of Turkish ethnicity and culture
   for participants. Beyond offering in situ data on the link between
   animal practices and ethnicity, the analyses and case suggest how and
   why sociologists should consider animals and nature as potential
   constitutive objects of ethnic identity and culture.

AB An in-depth case study of a Russian urban area explores the city's
   difficult democratic transition by analyzing changes in the network of
   civic affiliations among polity members. The research develops
   ideal-typical coalitional structures to understand this troubled
   transition. The case study uses data from membership lists of civic
   organizations to draw conclusions about the coalitional structure and
   its effects on democratic outcomes. This demonstrates that the politics
   of patronage and the marginalization of mediators made coordination
   among different parts of government difficult to achieve. The
   implication drawn from the case study is that the mediation of diverse
   factional interests through coalitions is an important condition for
   democratic consolidation.

AB The authors examine how personal, interpersonal, and structural
   resources are used in interaction to facilitate social actors' goal of
   self-verification. As the control of resources fosters
   self-verification, self-verification is expected to influence the
   availability of additional resources for actors to use to sustain
   themselves in future interactions. The authors employ a principal theory
   in sociology on the self, identity theory, to theoretically frame this
   research, and they use a representative sample of individuals in newly
   forged relationships to examine the reciprocal relationship between
   resources and the verification of a person identity and role identity.
   The findings reveal that the relationship between resource use and
   identity verification is mutually reinforcing: resource use facilitates
   identity verification and identity verification increases the resources
   available for future use. This reciprocal relationship occurs across
   identities and over time. The results provide insights on the idea that
   resources at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are mobilized among
   social actors to support the self and each other, help maintain a system
   of interaction, and reproduce culture and social structure.

   conceptual framework for understanding the association of children's
   mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this
   framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of
   attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider
   diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent
   classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and
   externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the
   classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school
   completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three
   sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude,
   disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational
   expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude
   and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health
   problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational
   trajectories.

AB The credibility of quantitative social science benefits from policies
   that increase confidence that results reported by one researcher can be
   verified by others. Concerns about replicability have increased as the
   scale and sophistication of analyses increase the possible dependence of
   results on subtle analytic decisions and decrease the extent to which
   published articles contain full descriptions of methods. The author
   argues that sociology should adopt standards regarding replication that
   minimize its conceptualization as an ethical and individualistic matter
   and advocates for a policy in which authors use independent online
   archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating
   published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the
   conditions of availability for any necessary materials that are not
   provided. The author responds to several objections that might be raised
   to increasing the transparency of quantitative sociology in this way and
   offers a candidate replication policy for sociology.

AB Sociologists have long reflected on what should be taught in sociology.
   In recent years, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) has
   produced several important publications on key principles and learning
   goals for the introductory course, However, little current work has
   systematically examined what peer-recognized leaders in the field deem
   important for introductory sociology. This paper is an effort to fill
   this research gap. Our research questions include: What do leaders think
   students should understand after an introduction to sociology course? Do
   the goals of Teaching Award winners differ from those of other leaders?
   How do the leaders' goals compare with those expressed in leading SoTL
   publications? To address these questions, we interviewed a sample of 44
   leaders in 2005-2006. Using qualitative content analysis, we
   systematically coded, analyzed, and compared their goals.

AB Teaching about intersecting, fluid and historically contingent
   identities has been taken up extensively within the sociology of race,

   has been virtually left out of this robust literature. This article
   explores the challenges raised through teaching the course "Jewish Women
   in Contemporary America," and links these challenges to the pedagogy of
   race, class and gender more broadly. Using the classroom as a research
   site, the authors conducted post-course interviews with students and
   kept detailed field notes on class sessions. The authors use Judith
   Butler's theorization of performativity to analyze classroom dynamics.
   After redesigning and teaching the course a second time, the authors
   conclude that the relationship between "experience" and "theory" must be
   constantly interrogated by both instructor and students; that personal
   narratives merit space within the classroom, but must be problematized;
   and a critical Jewish Women's Studies, based on illuminating the
   socially constructed and hybrid character of contemporary Jewish
   American women's identities, can help to expose the tendency to
   methodological essentialism still prevalent in much of the feminist
   race, class, and gender literature.

AB Affirmative action, a controversial topic about which students have many
   misconceptions, lends itself especially well to a sociological analysis.
   This paper describes an approach to teaching that: 1) informs students
   of different affirmative action programs; 2) gives them the opportunity
   to apply and integrate a variety of concepts and research findings
   covered in our sociology courses; 3) allows us to assess how well
   students understand affirmative action and to what degree they retain
   myths about the programs, and 4) covers an emotionally charged topic
   with enough depth to go beyond surface reactions. We find that this
   integrated approach dispels some of the most common myths, leads
   students to become more thoughtful and analytical, and gives them a good
   foundation from which to examine affirmative action in the future.

AB Jeffrey Alexander's recent book on cultural sociology argues that
   sociologists must grant the realm of ideas autonomy to determine
   behavior, unencumbered by interference from instrumental or material
   factors. He criticizes the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu as "weak" for
   failing to give autonomy to culture by reducing it to self-interested
   behavior that immediately reflects class position. However, Alexander's
   arguments seriously distort and misstate Bourdieu's theory, which
   provides for the relative autonomy of culture through the concepts of
   habitus and field. Because habitus is a set of durable dispositions
   conditioned by past structures, it may contradict the changed structures
   of the present. Further, the influence of the habitus is always mediated
   by the structure and strategies of the field of contest in which it is
   deployed, so that the same habitus may motivate different actions in
   different circumstances. However, Alexander is correct to argue that in
   Bourdieu's theory culture generally serves to reproduce, not contradict
   social structures. Yet Bourdieu addresses this and other problems in his
   later work, in which he argues for the existence of certain cultural
   universals transcending particular structures.

   disprove historical causality but, on the contrary, depends on belief in
   causality. Sometimes, this is only an implicit belief in the cliches of
   folk historiography; occasionally, a serious sociology is explicitly
   invoked. In either case, there is a tendency to misperceive how
   historical causality works through broadly-based processes that are not

AB Travis Hirschi's control or social bonding theory argues that those
   persons who have strong and abiding attachments to conventional society
   (in the form of attachments, involvement, investment, and belief) are
   less likely to deviate than persons who have weak or shallow bonds.
   Later, Gottfredson and Hirschi moved away from the social bond as the
   primary factor in deviance, and toward an emphasis on self-control. In
   short, low self-control is associated with higher levels of deviance and
   criminality irrespective of the strength or weakness of one's social
   bonds. In this article I argue that Talcott Parsons' AGIL schema easily
   incorporates Hirschi's social bond into its broader analytical
   framework. Furthermore, from within the logical framework of Parsons'
   system, Hirschi's move from an emphasis on social bonds to an emphasis
   on self-control is wholly compatible with, and even anticipated by, the
   AGIL schema. The article illustrates, and argues for, the continuing
   importance of theoretical subsumption in sociology and criminology.
   Lastly, a set of testable hypotheses is generated based upon this
   theoretical reformulation.

AB Here we assess the limitations of "social physics" methods for making
   predictions of future social conditions in order to contribute to the
   development of an alternative model of scientific sociology. First, we
   discuss the complexities inherent in causal analyses of social
   phenomena, where social organizing principles change historically and
   causal forces interact to generate outcomes. Second, we analyze the
   assumptions that underlie prediction in the social sciences by using the
   population projections of demographers as an illustrative example.
   Demographers typically make projections assuming the future will be the
   same as the (recent) past. This approach neglects the possibility of
   abrupt historical change, contingent events, and emergent social
   structures. Third, we argue that historical contingency is an essential
   and necessary consideration in any analysis of the world. A historical
   materialist approach provides the basis for better formulating
   nomothetic and idiographic modes of explanation and appreciates the
   important connections between the two. Sociological inquiry should be an
   attempt to distinguish between truly nomothetic processes and emergent
   historical background conditions that only appear nomothetic in a
   specific historical era. We close with an argument for the importance of
   developing a sociological science that runs parallel to nonmechanistic
   approaches in the biological sciences.

AB Although the philosophy of pragmatism influenced American sociology,
   specifically that of symbolic interactionism, its use as a tool for
   explanation of everyday life has been underutilized throughout
   sociology. In this article, pragmatism, specifically the ideas of George
   Herbert Mead and John Dewey provide a framework for the understanding of
   grieving, specifically as it relates to people with mental retardation.
   Both Mead and Dewey's use and inclusion of physics into their
   philosophies proved paramount in their assertions regarding Cartesian or
   ontological dualism. They then demonstrated through the inclusion of
   quantum physics how to avoid positivism, thereby creating the necessary
   link of science with human perception and human action. Mead's use of
   the Theory of Relativity, as well as Sociality; and Dewey's
   incorporation of the Uncertainty Principle, and addressing the sum of
   possibilities, provides a context where the grieving process of people
   with mental retardation will be much more pronounced. People with mental
   retardation, by definition, through their neural networks have an
   inability to perceive existence in a manner that is functionally the
   same as the rest of the population. Their abilities influence how people
   with mental retardation relate to themselves or environment, thereby
   creating either fewer realities or systems from which to interact, or
   creating ones that are functionally dissimilar from the typical
   population, hence the label "mental retardation;" therefore, the loss of
   someone or something creates a greater hole or emptiness for people with
   mental retardation than the rest of society.

AB Recently, there has been a proliferation of measures responding to
   demands for accountability and transparency. Using the example of media
   rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological
   concept of reactivity-the idea that people change their behavior in
   reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured-offers a useful lens
   for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed
   for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of
   public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms,
   self-fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and
   then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This
   approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures
   change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is
   important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more
   systematically.

   "organizational imprinting hypothesis," is frequently cited but remains
   little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship
   studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws
   on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in
   selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may
   remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the

AB Sociological explanations of the Salem witch trials, and of witch-hunts

   A more interpretive approach to the explanation of Salem is proposed: an
   analysis of the intersection of the gendered symbolization of witchcraft
   in colonial Massachusetts and the larger tensions within Puritan culture
   at the close of the 17th century. A broad theoretical implication of
   this interpretive shift is also proposed: that a cultural-sociological
   approach to witch-hunting as symbolic action can bring together feminist
   theorizations of witch-hunting as an exercise in patriarchal power with
   the social history of the broad, structural causes of witch-hunting in
   pre-modern Europe and New England.

AB As higher education accreditation agencies emphasize achievement of
   general education learning goals for undergraduate students, departments
   are increasingly required to identify and assess the contributions of
   their disciplines to achievement of these goals. This exploratory study
   conducted at a large urban university and its satellite campus seeks to
   identify students' perceptions of the contributions of the Introduction
   to Sociology course to the general education goals specified by a single
   university. This study also seeks to identify the most frequently used
   pedagogies used by introductory sociology instructors. Results indicate
   students perceive that Introduction to Sociology facilitates achievement
   of critical thinking skills, integration and application of knowledge,
   and understanding of society and culture. Results also indicate that
   lecture is a nearly ubiquitous teaching strategy. Students report
   instructors utilize in-class discussion frequently. Small group
   activities, writing assignments, videos, and online discussion were less
   frequently utilized.

AB This article describes an exercise that explores how race categories and
   classifications are socially constructed scientifically. In an
   introductory sociology setting, students compare their perceptions of
   the size of minority populations with counts from the U.S. Census. In a
   series of debriefing sessions, students analyze both their perceptions
   and Census counts as social constructions of the moral phenomena we call
   race. In the process, students are introduced to Census data and the
   Census web site as well as to historical and theoretical literature on
   the social construction of race. Students are then asked to reflect
   critically about the scientific practices in which race is constructed
   as a social fact, and in particular, to consider their own roles in
   these practices as users and subjects of race categories. The larger
   goal is to help students to develop a critical sociological imagination
   that productively engages the analysis of race in contemporary society.

AB Mirroring increased cultural and disciplinary attention to sexuality,
   many introductory sociology textbooks have begun to include coverage of
   the topic. Our study first assesses the extent of textual coverage of
   sexuality in a sample of 38 introductory textbooks published after 2000.
   Secondly, we focus on 14 textbooks with a sexuality chapter and/or
   textbooks with more than the average textual coverage of sexuality. We
   find that the emergent "core" of the sociology of sexuality centers on
   sex research, historical and cross-cultural trends in sexuality, media
   representations, gender and sexuality, homosexuality and society, and
   sexual violence. These textbooks vary widely in their attention to the
   intersection of race, class and sexuality and theoretical applications.
   We find lingering heteronormativity, homogenization of homosexuality,
   and problematic representations of non-normative sexuality within the
   chapters. We conclude with comments on the relevance of these findings
   and offer some suggestions to ensure that coverage of sexuality better
   reflects scholarship and discourse within the discipline.

AB Eggs and sperm are parallel bodily goods in that each contributes half

   produced by differently sexed bodies, allowing for a comparative
   analysis of how the social process of bodily commodification varies
   based on sex and gender Drawing on interview and observational data from
   two egg agencies and two sperm banks in the United States, this article
   compares how staff recruit, screen, market, and compensate women and men
   donors. Results show how gendered norms inspire more altruistic rhetoric
   in egg donation than in sperm donation, producing different regimes of
   bodily commodification for women and men. I conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings for debates in sociology of gender about
   biological differences among women and men and the cultural norms
   attributed to these differences; debates in economic sociology about how
   social factors shape the expansion of the market; and debates in medical
   sociology about the intersection of the market and medical practice.

   of times, but which becomes a bad if and when it can no longer be
   exchanged. We describe a game involving such goods, and show that
   non-acceptance is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for rational
   egoists. Contrastingly, experiments with human subjects show willingness
   to accept such goods under a variety of conditions. Acceptance of the
   hot potato is positively related to payoff size and to the length of the
   remaining chain, but negatively related to the number of potential
   exchange partners. We find that subjects' behaviors are consistent with
   collectively oriented behavior, in contrast with their personal
   accounts. Implications for rational choice theory and economic sociology

AB Patterns of postsecondary attendance in the United States continue to be
   stratified by socioeconomic background and race/ethnicity. We suggest
   that inequalities in knowledge of the costs of going to college
   contribute to persistent patterns of stratification. We hypothesize that
   disadvantaged parents who believe their child will attend college are
   less certain of the costs of college attendance than more advantaged
   parents. As a result, they are less able or willing to provide an
   estimate of the costs of college attendance, more likely to
   over-estimate those costs if they do provide an estimate, and more
   likely to make larger errors in estimation than comparable middle-class
   or white parents. Using nationally representative data, we find mixed
   support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents
   and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college
   tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On
   average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that
   are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We discuss
   implications of these findings for sociological theory and for
   inequality in postsecondary education. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB This paper examines social pattern analysis, the yet-unarticulated
   research strategy that guides formal sociologists in their efforts to
   distill generic social patterns from their specific cultural,
   situational, and historical contexts. Following in the implicit
   methodological footsteps of Georg Simmel, social pattern analysts view
   specific sociohistorical configurations as mere instantiations of such
   patterns, thereby deliberately disregarding various idiosyncrasies of
   the particular communities, events, and social situations they examine.
   Analytically focused, they thus draw their evidence from multiple social
   contexts, thereby making their essentially decontextualized findings
   more generalizable. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to historians and
   ethnographers, they try to highlight universality rather than
   singularity, thereby focusing their attention on the common formal
   features of any given pattern across those contexts while deliberately
   ignoring differences among its various specific manifestations. The
   outcome of such transcultural, transsituational, and transhistorical
   (that is, transcontextual) mode of inquiry is an empirically grounded
   "social geometry."

   theoretically robust concept of environment. Building on insights from
   classical and contemporary social theory, the authors argue that the
   study of genetic influence on behavior needs to incorporate sociological
   understandings of contextual effects. The authors propose five points
   for evaluating behavioral genetic studies' conceptualization of

   Bourdieu offered a highly suggestive reading and analysis of Gustave
   Flaubert's Sentimental Education. Bourdieu's approach has been
   extraordinarily influential in recent years in both the sociology of
   culture and, increasingly, literary criticism. Yet, his treatment of
   Flaubert's work, this article argues, despite its indisputable insight
   is problematic in several ways. This article has two objectives in this
   connection: (1) to show how the weaknesses in Bourdieu's treatment of
   the novel point to certain key weaknesses in his broader social theory,
   and (2) to use a parallel reading of the same novel both to demonstrate
   said weaknesses and to embark on a discussion of the future
   possibilities of the sociology of literature, arguing that though we
   should not simply engage in Bourdieuian readings of literary texts, a
   consideration of the late sociologist's work could inspire a renewed,
   vigorous research program in this area.

AB In this article, Jean-Paul Sartre's relationship to the negritude
   movement and black intellectuals in Paris between the 1940s and the
   1960s is examined in sociological and historical context. Sartre's
   version of negritude, developed in his 1948 treatise "Orphee noir"
   prefacing Leopold Senghor's collection of African and Malagasy poetry,
   is analyzed in terms of its role in shaping the discourses and debates
   surrounding negritude and the relationship of black intellectuals to the
   rest of French society. Sartre's phenomenological theories of race,
   juxtaposing dominant and subaltern ideologies, are contrasted with his
   dialectic of negritude. The antinegritude movement of the late 1960s is
   also considered with reference to Sartre's theories and inspiration.
   During this period, the relationship that Sartre established with
   Martinican intellectual and revolutionary Frantz Fanon helped to place
   Sartre into prominence as an activist and a theorist of decolonization
   and Third World politics. Sartre's theories of race, self, and society
   were integral to both his early and later works and warrant review as
   approaches to the sociology of culture and sources of reflection for
   contemporary postcolonial studies.

   about persons who are homeless and to increase students' sense of

   students formed a partnership with advocates and homeless clients to
   raise public awareness about homelessness and to organize advocacy and
   fund-raising events for the agency partner. The research element of the
   project used pre-tests and post-tests to assess changes in students'
   beliefs about social justice, self-efficacy, and perceptions of
   homelessness. When compared to students who took the class, but did not
   participate in the described service-learning project, Breaking Ground
   students experienced significant changes in a positive direction in
   their perceptions of individuals who are homeless. There were also some
   small changes in student feelings of self-efficacy and opinions on
   social justice. I explain these results and provide suggestions for
   implementation of similar projects.

AB When it comes to issues of equality and redistribution, sociologists are
   particularly prone to think in anti-cultural terms. External, objective,
   and material forces are conceived as determining unequal distributions
   without reference to the wills of actors via hegemony, domination,
   subordination. But if inequality is imposed by material and coercive
   force, then it can be remedied only by accumulating power and
   counterforce, and by exercising them in an instrumental and potentially
   coercive way. What is missing from this account is meaning, the
   recognition of its relative autonomy. The imposition of inequality, and
   struggles over justice, inclusion, and distribution, are mediated by
   cultural structures. Inequalities are nested inside the discourse of
   civil society, and so are demands for equality. Vis-a-vis the binary
   codes of civil society, protest movements pollute hegemonic forces and
   purify subordinate groups in its name.

   of culture that have become tacit or unarticulated over time. To make
   the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the
   use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi
   in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques
   derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not
   considered classical. Ironically, the Canal du Midi was promoted in
   propaganda campaigns, defining France as the New Rome, but the peasant
   women who actually carried Roman culture in their eyes and hands were
   not socially elevated enough to be New Romans, so they were written out
   of this story.

   sociology. The paper takes up Michael Burawoy's call for public
   sociology and discusses what rural sociologists have to offer to publics
   and how we stand to gain as a discipline in working with publics. The
   paper argues that rural sociologists' ability to adopt a cosmopolitan
   view while negotiating the complexities of global/local processes
   provides a useful theoretical stance for doing public sociology.
   Methodologically, both feminist methods and various approaches to
   networks can guide us as we do public sociology. Then, the paper
   provides two examples of recent efforts to do public sociology with a
   women's community group in Sri Lanka in response to the tsunami and with
   the Pennsylvania Women's Agricultural Network to illustrate the
   possibilities and limitations of working with networks. In conclusion,
   the paper addresses opportunities for doing public sociology, the
   challenges we face as we go public, and future work that is needed to
   develop theoretically and methodologically strong public rural
   sociology.

AB This research examines the individual-level and contextual correlates of
   punitive attitudes in the United States. Prior research suggests that
   the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas
   influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest
   on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as
   threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the
   concept of "perceived threat" and examining the association between
   aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive sentiments.
   Analysis of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong
   predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in
   areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a
   recent increase in the size of the African American population are more
   punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to material resources for white
   respondents. The results agree with racial threat perspectives on social
   control, but we go beyond extant research by unpacking the micro-level
   processes that are central to the threat hypothesis.

   extent to which they are compatible. In this paper I argue that because
   of the important obligation to protect human research subjects'
   identities (and, to a lesser extent, the proliferation of publicly
   available datasets), few researchers are actually in a position to
   implement this type of mixed methodology. Despite their noted advantages
   over mono-method designs, mixed method designs that start with
   quantitative data and subsequently supplement it with qualitative
   insights may not achieve the dominance that many have supposed and
   desired. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Critical literacy is akin to a sociological imagination as it involves
   the ability to distinguish between private troubles and public issues
   and the competency to use such distinctions to facilitate and engage in
   social change. This article is a case study of low-income rural Whites'
   personal interpretations of health and income inequalities with a
   concern for understanding the potential effectiveness of a community
   action program (CAP) designed to enhance their critical literacy.
   Findings reveal that low-income rural Whites predominantly use
   ideologies of individualism to interpret the inequalities experienced by
   others, they employ a pseudostructural level analysis tempered by
   individualism to interpret their experience of health and income
   inequalities, and they respond collectively along racial and national
   lines when considering overall inequalities. Based on these findings, I
   provide suggestions on how CAPs can more effectively elevate the
   critical literacy of low-income rural Whites.

AB R. W. Connell's path-breaking notion of multiple masculinities (Connell,
   1995) and hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 1987, 1995) have been taken up
   as central constructs in the sociology of gender. Although there has
   been a great deal of empirical research and theory published that has
   built upon and utilized Connell's concepts, an adequate
   conceptualization of hegemonic femininity and multiple femininities has
   not yet been developed. To redress this, the author presents a
   theoretical framework that builds upon the insights of Connell and
   others, offers a definition of hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic
   femininity that allows for multiple configurations within each, and that
   can be used empirically across settings and groups. The author also
   outlines how hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic femininity are
   implicated in and intersect with other systems of inequality such as
   class, race, and ethnicity.

AB The Zapatistas and Sandinistas both invoked historical figures in their
   rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is
   explained by a model of path-dependent memory work that is sensitive to
   how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of
   historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct
   reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of
   different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational
   trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic
   possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing
   contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the
   opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories
   condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the
   collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics
   literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take
   seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.

AB This article traces the transatlantic diffusion of Pierre Bourdieu's
   ideas into American sociology. We find that rather than being received
   as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate
   new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used
   their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu's
   sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program
   in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for
   presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of
   articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far
   from a recent fad, Bourdieu's ideas steadily diffused into American
   sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books
   in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu's key concepts
   (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four
   core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).

AB For several decades, the concept of the niche has enriched sociological
   theory. The niche represents the position or function of an entity, such
   as an organization or population of organizations, within a larger
   community environment. Using the concept of the niche allows researchers
   to go beyond classifying entities to understanding (a) their life
   chances under different and changing environmental conditions and (b)
   how they interact under the competitive conditions induced by a finite
   environment. We briefly review the intellectual history of the niche
   concept as it came from bioecology to sociology. The bulk of the article
   reviews the two major streams of sociological research that use the
   niche concept: the population ecology of organizations and McPherson's
   ecology of affiliation. Finally, we survey commonalities between these
   approaches and highlight new directions, including applications that
   take the niche concept well beyond its origins in organizational
   studies.

AB Sociologists use negative feedback loop systems to explain identity
   processes, interpersonal behavior, crowd behavior, organizational
   behavior, social relationships, and the behavior of political systems.
   Control system models help us to understand how actors enact social
   roles with enough stability to preserve institutional arrangements,
   while still demonstrating remarkable creativity in unusual
   circumstances. These theories take us away from an oversocialized view
   of the actor, without relegating us to exclusive reliance on grounded
   theory. They provide a foundation for several generative theories of
   adaptive, goal-seeking behavior on the part of social actors and
   institutions. This chapter begins by tracing the history of control
   theorizing in sociology, then-describes several contemporary theoties
   that rely on control imagery, reviews the empirical support for these
   theories, describes some of their significant points of overlap and
   departure, and examines some of the key tested-and untested-implications
   of a control system approach in sociology.

   sophisticated media wires of true or false fears manipulating our

   address both issues, general audience magazines were examined to uncover
   trends in the meanings of nature from 1945 through 1980. A qualitative
   and semiotic approach was used to examine the data. The analysis
   revealed a predominance of appreciative meanings and little qualitative
   change despite the rise of environmental struggle midway through the

AB Some commentators have suggested that the embrace of "identity politics"
   has gone too far and that we are now in a putative postidentity moment.
   Within the academy this argument has been articulated from two divergent
   positions. The first derides identity politics as a move away from
   materialist concerns. The second, more conservative, position argues
   that identity politics is at fault for being over-political, for reading
   politics into every aspect of knowledge production. I argue that
   identity is in fact a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition
   for any effective oppositional politics. I further suggest that these
   arguments are themselves evidence of the articulation of (white, male,
   and heterosexual) institutional power within the academic field of
   (sport) sociology. As an alternative, I argue for the renewal of a
   critical public sport sociology that draws upon and extends the cultural

   specialization was developing, and seeks to apply his ideas to the
   development of SoTL in sociology today. I make three specific
   recommendations: (1) maintaining the independence of SoTL as a separate
   area of interest and scholarship while enthusiastically working with and
   drawing upon the work of others within and outside sociology, (2)
   broadening the content of SoTL investigations to address teaching and
   learning from additional perspectives, and (3) utilizing an increasingly

AB Academic sociologists have recently increased their focus on improving

   teachers and universities, improving curriculum, and enhancing teacher
   training. I propose that this list be expanded to include setting
   curricular standards. Current trends in educational reform center on
   standards-based education, and although many social science disciplines
   have adapted to this trend, sociology's focus on standards is limited to
   undergraduate education. I analyze the existing state sociology
   standards by measuring them against the American Sociological
   Association's (ASA) Advanced Placement Sociology course, the National
   Council for Social Studies standards, and the sample learning goals from
   Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major Updated (McKinney et al. 2005).
   The results indicate that there are some substantial differences in the
   learning goals set forth by the ASA and those set forth by the states. I
   suggest that since the academic sociological community is in an ideal
   position to address high school social studies content in a variety of
   disciplines, we should expand our efforts in this area.

   voted to "encourage departments to consider and implement the

   including a four-level sequence and a capstone course. I assess the

PD JAN 2007
PY 2007
AB Decades of research have documented the positive impacts of cooperative
   learning on student success: increased learning, retention through
   graduation, improved critical thinking, and intrinsic motivation. One
   cooperative teaching technique, however, has received relatively little
   attention. In the two-stage cooperative, group, or "pyramid" exam
   students first take an exam individually-as in traditional testing-and
   then take the same exam together with their learning group, with the
   exam grade being a weighted combination of their individual and group
   scores. This approach uses the exam itself not only for evaluation, but
   also as a learning tool. Although some researchers have studied group
   exams, they have not isolated the impact of group tests from individual
   achievernent-an important omission. Using data from a mass lecture
   introductory sociology course, I found that holding individual
   achievement constant the group exam process significantly increased
   learning both for students who knew the material initially and for those
   who did not. This suggests that cooperative exams not only enhance
   learning but also allow for the process and form of testing to become
   more closely linked to the process and form of teaching and learning.

AB Routes to economic development attract considerable attention in
   community and rural sociology. Social scientists draw increasingly on
   studies of social capital and environmental surroundings as they examine
   the factors that facilitate and inhibit economic development. However,
   few empirical analyses exist that analyze the impact of the combination
   of social infrastructure and natural capital on different forms of
   economic development such as on industrial recruitment and
   self-development. Using data collected from six communities in
   Washington State, the interaction of a community's social infrastructure
   and natural capital on industrial recruitment and self-development
   efforts is examined. Results suggest that while natural capital
   positively impacts a community's successful recruitment of outside
   industries, it is not significant for a community's level of
   self-development. However, a community's social infrastructure, measured
   by the existence of active civic organizations, local businesses that
   support local community projects, community-wide fund-raising capacity,
   and extra-local linkages to nearby communities, state, and national
   agencies, positively affects both industrial recruitment and
   self-development. These findings illustrate the need for communities and
   local activists to carefully weigh their advantages and potential
   shortcomings when deciding on an economic development strategy.

AB Research on quality of life in sociology is largely focused on a narrow
   range of dimensions including affect, happiness and satisfaction. It
   largely avoids a concern with the meanings that provide people with the
   purpose, significance, validity and coherence that are a basis of social
   relationships and social integration. Evidence is presented that people
   experience lowered affect in some challenging and stressful situations
   that simultaneously generate meanings that enhance the quality of their
   lives, and that experiences of high affect along with impoverished
   meanings produce low quality of life. This strongly suggests that
   meaning may be a more fundamental dimension of life quality than is
   affect. Meanings may also enhance the quality of life by motivating
   people's involvement in activities that promote social integration and
   the quality of social relationships. Sociologists should work to further
   develop the theoretical and empirical basis of quality of life so that
   it more fully includes dimensions that reflect the meanings that provide
   purpose and significance in people's lives.

   citizenship in the United States and Canada to build a new approach to
   the study of citizenship and political incorporation. I consider three
   existing models of citizenship: an approach that considers citizenship
   adoption as the product of cost/benefit calculations; an approach that
   understands individuals and groups to be differentially endowed with the
   skills, resources and interests necessary to acquire citizenship; and an
   approach that believes countries adopt citizenship regimes which either
   include or shut out immigrants. I then offer an alternative model of
   structured mobilization which views political incorporation as a social
   process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and
   local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by
   government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement. The material
   and symbolic resources provided by government shape the ability and
   interest of "social helpers" to assist with and mobilize around
   citizenship. The article concludes by considering the implications of
   structured mobilization for various debates in immigration and political
   sociology.

AB Each workplace operates within a cultural context in which local
   features of interaction influence how employees conceptualize their
   workplace self. Building on small-group research, I argue that
   understanding these idiocultures as action arenas helps to specify how
   group knowledge, practices, and beliefs are expressed and affect
   occupational identity. To demonstrate the power of microcultures, I
   analyzed local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) through
   ethnographic methods. I focused on the Chicago office, demonstrating how
   its culture, which emphasizes autonomy and resistance to authority,
   shapes the staff's images of scientific practice and the contours of
   being a scientist. The culture is revealed in their joking relations as
   well as in other office traditions. I then compared this culture with
   that of Flowerland, a spin-up office established in the 1990s. These two
   offices use their cultures to differentiate themselves, creating
   distinct work practices. As all work groups have local cultures, giving
   greater attention to small-group dynamics helps us understand how
   workers define themselves, how cultures differ, and how the effects of
   these differences shape the experience of work.

AB This article examines historical transformations of Japanese collective
   memory of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by utilizing a theoretical
   framework that combines a model of reiterated problem solving and a
   theory of cultural trauma. I illustrate how the event of the nuclear
   fallout in March 1954 allowed actors to consolidate previously
   fragmented commemorative practices into a master frame to define the
   postwar Japanese identity in terms of transnational commemoration of
   "Hiroshima." I also show that nationalization of trauma of "Hiroshima"
   involved a shift from pity to sympathy in structures of feeling about
   the event. This historical study suggests that a reiterated
   problem-solving approach can be efficacious in analyzing how
   construction of national memory of a traumatic event connects with the
   recurrent reworking of national identity, on the one hand, and how a
   theory of cultural trauma can be helpful in exploring a synthesis of
   psychological and sociological approaches to commemoration of a
   traumatic event, on the other.

   construction of reality. By revisiting the lifeworld Berger and Luckmann
   depicted 40 years ago, I seek to highlight the changes the Internet has
   brought to our everyday lives. I argue that the spread of the Internet
   has altered the conditions of interpersonal contact, as well as the
   realms of the lifeworld in which we live. Specifically, the Internet has
   created a new spatiotemporal zone-the zone of the "there and now," a new
   mode of communication-the electronic text chat, and a new social
   gathering place-the online public domain. These creations have in turn
   contributed to the rise of the realm of "consociated contemporaries,"
   the formation of a new matrix of social contact, the maintenance of the
   subjective reality through text chat, and the involvement of the online
   world in the socialization process. In light of such changes, I join
   those who call for a revision of the existing sociological stance on
   human interaction.

AB In this work I argue that the study of deviance as distinct from crime
   is no longer a productive specialty in sociology. I attribute the cause
   of the demise of the field to its over reliance on the assumption of
   cultural relativity. In contrast to the relativist position, I argue
   that behavior that causes harm will be more likely to be condemned by
   public opinion and that there will be less variation in attitudes toward
   behaviors that cause more harm. Using data from the General Social
   Survey, I find support for the hypothesis that a "deviant" sexual
   behavior that can have a victim, extramarital sex, will be more
   consensually condemned than "deviant" sexual behaviors that do not have
   victims, premarital sex and homosexual sex. I recommend that future
   research focus on the study of values, as the validity of cultural
   relativity can be empirically evaluated.

AB This article examines why the Stonewall riots became central to gay

   comparative-historical analysis of Stonewall and four events similar to
   it that occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the
   1960s. The Stonewall riots were remembered because they were the first
   to meet two conditions: activists considered the event commemorable and
   had the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle. That this
   conjuncture occurred in New York in 1969, and not earlier or elsewhere,
   was a result of complex political developments that converged in this
   time and place. The success of the national commemorative ritual planned
   by New York activists depended on its resonance, not only in New York
   but also in other US. cities. Gay community members found Stonewall
   commemorable and the proposed parade an appealing form for
   commemoration. The parade was amenable to institutionalization, leading
   it to survive over time and spread around the world. The Stonewall story
   is thus an achievement of gay liberation rather than an account of its
   origins.

AB This ethnographic account of the rituals of risk and error after NASA's

   traveled across the disciplinary boundary to public and policy domains.
   The analysis shows that analogy was the instigator of it all, enabled by
   the social mechanisms of professional legitimacy, conversation,
   technologies, time, networks, and social support. It demonstrates the
   work sociologists do when theory travels from professional sociology to
   nonacademic audiences and what happens to the theory and the sociologist
   in the process. It reveals the tensions when professional sociology,
   critical sociology, public sociology, and policy sociology are joined. A
   study of sociology in the field, it shows how sociologists negotiate the
   meaning of their work in a nonacademic situation. Thus, this account
   contributes to research and theory on social boundaries, the diffusion
   of ideas, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and current debates
   about public sociology and the role of the sociologist, adding to the
   sociology of our own work.

   that they alter citizens' relationships to labor markets, directly

AB While sociologists and the public at large are increasingly interested
   in the life conditions of animals, conceptual and empirical development
   of the topic is limited. This paper seeks to further develop the
   sociological research on attitudes toward animal well-being. We build on
   insights from contemporary stratification theory to explain the nature
   of animal attitudes and their determinants. We also extend past work by
   examining a broader range of factors related to attitudes about animal
   wellbeing, focusing on place, other social structural factors, and
   individuals' unique animal-related experiences. Data are from a survey
   of over 4,000 Ohio residents conducted in 2002. We find that childhood
   experience has the greatest place-based effect on attitudes. Other
   findings highlight the importance of social structural factors,
   suggesting support for the "underdog hypothesis." Women, people
   experiencing economic hardship, those with less education, younger and
   middle aged people, and blacks tend to be more concerned with animal
   well-being. Individualized, experiential variables are also important.
   Our results reflect the complexity of attitudes about animals and point
   to the need for greater sociological attention to factors left largely
   unexplored in previous studies, including childhood place-based factors,
   economic hardship, and individuals' unique animal-related experiences.

   analysis of how 307 undergraduate students at a Midwestern state
   university interpreted a black-and-white photograph of an individual
   masturbating, this article finds that assessments of the degree to which
   the image should be considered art and/or pornography are associated
   with self-reported indicators of both cultural competencies and
   identities. Indicators of religious and conventional identities and of
   training with regard to photography stand out in this regard. The
   intersection of the constructions of pornography and art enabled the
   authors to classify participants as Nonartistic Conservatives,
   Nonartistic Liberals, Artistic Liberals, and Artistic Conservatives and
   to show that interpretations are a consequence of how persons are
   simultaneously situated in relation to both moral and aesthetic
   criteria.

   meaning of the telling. This article introduces the concepts of
   "notification norms" and the "information order," showing how the former
   constrain the behavior of nodes in social networks as well as enabling
   manipulation of the relationships that comprise those networks.
   "Notification" is defined as information transmission motivated by role
   obligations and notification norms as social rules that govern such
   transmission. These rules produce patterns of information dissemination
   different from what individual volition would yield and from what
   technology makes possible. The capacity to wield a socially sanctioned
   repertoire of notification rules is a learned competence. Competent
   notifiers must also understand the local epistemological ecology-the
   distribution and trajectory of information, as well as the projects,
   concerns, and priorities of one's fellows. This study of notification
   introduces the broader concept of "the information order" and is a first
   step in the project of a sociology of information.

AB This study contributes to the sociological study of suicide via an
   exploration of the implications and application of literary texts in
   sociological analysis. The examination of two pairs of literary texts
   suggests that some cases of suicide can be self-affirming. When the
   characters find themselves in circumstances that threaten their
   perception of who they are in their social contexts, they may choose the
   possibility of death over life with a change in self-concept. The
   interpretation of the four selected narrative cases of self-affirmative
   suicide is nestled in complexities of self-identity: two from The Iliad
   by Homer, and one each from Andorra and I'm Not Stiller by Max Frisch.
   Relating the findings to Turner's theory of impulsive versus
   institutional loci of real self, the article argues that institutionally
   constituted characters are more likely than impulsive-selves to find
   self-killing an acceptable resolution to their crises of identity. The
   findings are discussed in relation to classic theory in the sociology of
   suicide, concepts of the real self, and the use of literature in social
   science research.

   this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators
   are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are
   emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on
   ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant
   causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in
   practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis
   routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the
   assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice.
   Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used

   question textbooks, which they regard as "gospel truth". How can we get
   our students to go beyond both textbook myths and mainstream folklore to
   grapple with misleading and inaccurate statements? In this article I
   suggest several strategies to raise awareness of myths about qualitative
   research, explain why several common statements about qualitative
   methods are myths, and suggest classroom strategies for engaging

AB The maximization of productivity and labor efficiency has been a
   hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of
   these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated
   provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view
   this model as a panacea for providing food to a modem industrial
   workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this
   system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial
   model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural
   community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in
   this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses
   toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in
   a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one
   such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize
   agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security,

   detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the

   international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of
   agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of

AB Although many of us would like to get beyond lecturing, we often lack
   concrete strategies for doing so, particularly in our larger classes.
   This paper suggests one such strategy for creating a discussion-based
   course. The success of such a course is predicated on students reading
   and thinking about the course material (receiving "first exposure")
   prior to attending class so that class time can be devoted to more
   substantively engaging activities grounded in guided discussion. The
   vehicle I propose for achieving this first exposure to the course
   material is the "Course Preparation Assignment" (CPA). This article
   explains the rationale for discussion-based courses, describes the
   development and use of CPAs, and assesses a discussion-based course by
   comparing it to a traditional lecture course on several outcomes. The
   assessment reveals that the use of these assignments to create a
   discussion-based course has been a great success, allowing me to foster
   student engagement with the course material by spending the majority of
   class time coordinating, facilitating, and leading discussions, rather
   than constantly lecturing at the students.

AB Research has documented that collaborative learning groups improve

   However, researchers know much less about how collaborative learning
   groups may influence student behavior and the extent to which their
   utility extends to testing as well as projects and papers. In an effort
   to address these gaps, we used quasi-experimental and survey data to
   examine the effects of collaborative testing on Introduction to
   Sociology students' learning, behavior and attitudes. Findings indicate
   that collaborative testing improved students' behavior and attitudes. In
   comparison to a control group, students who participated in
   collaborative testing reported completing more of their assigned
   readings and had improved attitudes toward their learning, the testing
   process, and sociology.

   Writing to address the interrelated pedagogical problems of
   misconceptions, resistance, retention, and transfer. I analyze the use
   of this combined method in a course on racial and ethnic relations and
   provide examples to suggest that students commonly use four ideologies
   to understand racial and ethnic inequality: blaming the victim,
   justification, naturalization, and colorblind racism. I describe how I
   helped students identify and unlearn these ideological misconceptions
   and replace them with a sociological conceptual framework. I analyze the
   results of a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test showing that
   students' use of ideology declined on each subsequent exam while their
   use of sociology increased during the semester and was partially
   retained months later. Finally I discuss the study's limitations and the
   utility of students learning the falseness of ideology.

AB Are American attitudes toward economic inequality different from those
   in other countries? One tradition in sociology suggests American
   "exceptionalism," while another argues for convergence across nations in
   social norms, such as attitudes toward inequality. This article uses
   International Social Survey Program (ISSP) microdata to compare
   attitudes in different countries toward what individuals in specific
   occupations "do earn " and what they "should earn," and to distinguish
   value preferences for more egalitarian outcomes from other confounding
   attitudes and perceptions. The authors suggest a method for summarizing
   individual preferences for the leveling of earnings and use kernel
   density estimates to describe and compare the distribution of individual
   preferences over time and cross-nationally. They find that subjective
   estimates of inequality in pay diverge substantially from actual data,
   and that although Americans do not, on the average, have different
   preferences for aggregate (in)equality, there is evidence for:
   1. Less awareness concerning the extent of inequality at the top of the
   income distribution in America
   2. More polarization in attitudes among Americans
   3. Similar preferences for "leveling down" at the top of the earnings
   distribution in the United States, but also
   4. Less concern for reducing differentials at the bottom of the
   distribution.

AB Research on the new managerial regimes has been hampered by its neglect
   of the question of human agency - specifically, the nature of workers'
   responses to the advent of the new forms of work organization. Drawing
   on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the
   author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and
   effects of workers' responses to the changes they confront in their work
   situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on
   structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the
   fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing
   a fourfold typology of workers' responses, the author shows how each
   type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These
   findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a
   relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and
   practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the
   restructuring of their jobs.

AB The author develops the concept of legal framing to expand theoretical
   knowledge on the cultural and symbolic processes that enable, constrain,
   and transform social movements. Merging insights from social movement
   theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the
   author argues that law is a type of " master frame," and that mobilizing
   law's " constitutive" symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely
   overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity,
   and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing
   processes through historical-narrative analysis of the women's movement
   and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical
   evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women's
   movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a
   symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of
   gender ("protective" vs. "equal" treatment) and that this contest was
   waged in explicitly legal terms.

AB "Balance" in the classroom has been the subject of recent debate in
   academic and public spheres, with some calling for legislation to
   prevent instructors from "indoctrinating" students. The debate over
   balance is important to sociology because the discipline is sometimes
   characterized as overtly liberal and activist; but the implications of
   balance for teaching and learning remain unclear. In this article, we
   present the results of a study in which we operationalized balance as
   students' perceptions of whether instructors discussed points of view
   other than their own and invited criticism of their ideas. Using OLS
   regression on undergraduate classes' quantitative evaluations of
   sociology instructors at Indiana University during the 2002-2003
   academic year (N = 99 classes), we asked whether classes perceived their
   sociology instructors to be balanced and whether positive perceptions
   led to better evaluations. We also asked about the relative influence of
   sociology classes' perceptions of balance compared to other influences.
   We found that most classes perceived their instructors as balanced and
   instructors who were perceived as being more balanced received better
   evaluations. However, we also found that balance was not as important as
   other factors in influencing evaluations. We discuss implications.

   enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence analysis
   to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network resources to
   buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain knowledge and
   legitimacy. During this period, networked property grew, stabilized, and
   involved a growing proportion of foreign capital. Cohesive networks of
   recombinant property were robust, and in fact integrated foreign
   investment. Although multinationals, through their subsidiaries,
   dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
   that they also built durable networks. These findings suggest that
   developing economies do not necessarily face a forced choice between
   networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.

AB Rather than seeking ivory-tower isolation, members of the Rural
   Sociological Society have always been distinguished by a willingness to
   work with specialists from a broad range of disciplines, and to work on
   some of the world's most challenging problems. What is less commonly
   recognized is that the willingness to reach beyond disciplinary
   boundaries can contribute not just to the solution of real-world
   problems, but also to the advancement of the discipline itself. This
   point is increasingly being illustrated in studies of
   environment-society relationships. Most past discussions of humans'
   roles in environmental problems have focused on overall or average human
   impacts, but rural sociologists have played leading roles in identifying
   what I have come to call "the double diversion." First, rather than
   being well-represented by averages, environmental damages are often
   characterized by high levels of disproportionality, with much or most of
   the harm being created by the diversion of environmental rights and
   resources to a surprisingly small fraction of the relevant social
   actors. The disproportionality appears to be made possible in part
   through the second diversion, namely distraction the diversion of
   attention, largely through the taken-for-granted but generally erroneous
   assumption that the environmental harm "must" be for the benefit Of us
   all. There are good reasons why rural sociologists would have been among
   the first to notice both of these "diversions"-and why they will give
   even greater attention to both in the future.

   show that the level of women's autonomy depends on whether wives or
   husbands are respondents and that the response categories do not have
   the same cognitive or semantic meanings to men and women. The
   disagreement between men and women varies across communities for reasons
   that are not easy to explain. The items also contain random measurement
   error that attenuates the correlation between spousal reports. We

AB In this essay, I draw on a professional life history to suggest how
   sociological knowledge is generated by encounters with changing research
   opportunities, here called targets of opportunity. In my case, a study
   of rural communities led to unanticipated conclusions concerning
   buffering mechanisms that protected authorities by absorbing
   dissatisfactions and rebellions. Wartime research in a military setting
   identified sources of group solidarity and effective performance under
   stress. Major societal changes in racial/ethnic relations provided
   opportunities to develop new concepts and empirical findings. Synoptic
   studies of post-World War II American society led to extensive research
   on values and institutions. These macrosociological analyses of
   ethnicity and social systems, in turn, led me to a new sociology of war
   and interstate relations. I also offer here some critical reflections on
   recurrent issues and chronic controversies in American sociology. Final
   sections of the review deal with the continuing search for conceptual
   clarity and cumulative knowledge. I note the obstacles of disciplinary
   fragmentation, but my closing judgment is that sociology now has the
   base of substantial scientific knowledge and methodological expertise
   necessary for investigating crucial twenty-first century problems.

AB Sociology can be an important disciplinary bridge between the study of
   what demographers call forced migration and mortality and what legal
   sociologists and criminologists understand as war crimes. The challenge
   is to develop a critically informed sociological synthesis that joins
   our understanding of the frequently politicized health and violence
   dimensions of what are also diplomatically called "complex" humanitarian
   emergencies. The frequency of these emergencies is growing, and there is
   an increasing amount of data collected by governmental and
   nongovernmental organizations exposing large-scale violations of human
   rights and war crimes. Yet analyses of these data are often inadequate.
   Although the humanitarian emergency in Kosovo marked a high point in
   collaborative human rights research, the circumstances that allowed this
   collaboration are probably atypical. We consider how, in increasingly
   challenging circumstances such as the Darfur region of Sudan, population
   health and legal and criminological surveys can be joined to provide
   more comprehensive estimates of deaths resulting from violent attacks as
   well as from disease and starvation. The discipline of sociology, with
   its expertise in population-based surveys and other measurement and
   analytic techniques, has the capacity to bridge differences and to
   provide more meaningfully synthesized conclusions.

AB The literature on globalization and social movements emphasizes the
   ability of international non-governmental organizations to influence
   states and foster domestic social change. This article examines the
   dynamics of this process in an early international movement to combat
   prostitution in the late 1800s. Why did reformers succeed in their goal
   of abolishing the state regulation of prostitution earlier in some
   countries compared to others? A qualitative comparative-historical
   approach is used to outline local social movement dynamics and
   consequent paths to abolition in a subset of European countries (i.e.
   the Netherlands, France and Germany), as influenced by two international
   voluntary associations. The findings show that contestation between the
   associations - one more transnational than the other in practice -
   hampered abolitionist successes. International voluntary associations'
   organization, alliances and cultural framings, as they operated in local
   settings, affected the form of local movements as well as their
   outcomes. Rather than challenging state interests, international
   associations sometimes help to reinforce them.

AB This address is a retrospective of the past 25 years of Sociological
   Spectrum, journal of the Mid South Sociological Association (MSSA). It
   is divided into three sections: some descriptive notes, a brief
   examination of challenges presented by previous MSSA presidents, and my
   recommendations for considerations of gender and globalization that I
   hope will appear in future research published in the journal. The
   descriptive notes contain a discussion of who publishes in Spectrum,
   what topical themes are found in the publications, and a brief
   consideration of how these themes reflect sociology as a whole, and
   particularly the MSSA. In the section on challenges, I discuss
   recommendations and concerns from past presidential addresses and
   whether or not subsequent research has "listened" to the presidents. The
   final section is a brief consideration of how gender is being defined
   within much of current sociological research and some recommendations
   for moving beyond these definitions, including integration with concepts
   of race and globalization.

AB This paper examines the articulation of goals and means of sociological
   instruction in course syllabi. Three questions guide this inquiry.
   First, do sociology instructors articulate common learning goals? Second
   what pedagogical means do instructors commonly employ to meet these
   goals? Third to what extent have sociology instructors incorporated the
   recommendations presented in Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major
   (Eberts et al. 1990) and in its updated version (McKinney et al. 2004)?
   To answer these questions, we analyzed syllabi from 418 courses
   published by the American Sociological Association's Teaching Resource
   Center. We found that aside from course-specific goals, most syllabi
   shared only a few general, abstract goals in common. The pedagogical
   methods or requirements of students tended to be fairly traditional
   (readings, writing, and exams). Requirements that required more active
   types of learning were less common. While these goals and means do seem
   to reflect what sociologists consider to be important, they do not
   correspond closely to the American Sociological Associations Taskforce
   on the Undergraduate Major's recommendations for the sociology major.

   lessons learned from ASA's Minority Opportunities through School
   Transformation (MOST) Program, where curricular change was a
   departmental (not individual faculty) agenda. A critical mass of faculty
   in each IDA department developed and used quantitative modules in lower

AB Sociologists can make meaningful contributions to quantitative literacy
   by teaching sociological research skills in sociology classes, including
   introductory courses. We report on the effectiveness of requiring a
   research module in a large introductory class. The module is designed to
   teach both basic research skills and to increase awareness of race and
   gender inequality. We find that a majority of students are able to
   interpret basic percentage tables with a minimum of instruction. Under
   the condition that students are willing to acknowledge inequality in our
   occupational system, completing the research assignment increases their
   awareness of race and gender inequality. We argue that one of
   sociology's most powerful contributions to quantitative literacy is that
   our core content provides a challenging and relevant context in which to
   learn quantitative skills.

PD DEC 2005

AB Why do countries differ so much in the extent to which they adopt
   neoliberal, market-oriented reform in their infrastructure industries?
   Building on world-society and neo-institutional theories in sociology,
   this paper argues that international pressures of coercion, normative
   emulation, and competitive mimicry strongly influence the domestic
   adoption of market-oriented reform. The paper considers the effect of
   such pressures on the adoption of four reform elements: the
   privatization of state-owned firms, the formal separation of the
   regulatory authority from the executive branch, the de facto elimination
   of executive political influence on the regulatory authority, and the
   opening of the retail market to multiple service providers. It finds
   generally robust support for its arguments using a multivariate probit
   analysis of reform adoption in the telecommunications and electricity
   industries of as many as 71 countries and territories between 1977 and
   1999. The results also suggest that the coercive effect of lending by
   the IMF and World Bank differs for each reform element. The paper
   discusses the possibility that, by leading countries to adopt some
   reform elements but not others, international coercion may not produce
   ideal outcomes.

PD DEC 2005
PY 2005
AB Drawing insights from the ethnographies in the natural sciences, which
   have focused on the role of technical instruments in laboratory
   practices, this article asks, "What role do technical instruments play
   in the humanities?" Editions of La Comedie humaine, written by Honore de
   Balzac, are taken as a case study. Primarily based on ethnographic
   research with Balzac scholars, this article traces the evolution of
   Balzac text from a unified and unadorned text in the 1930s, to a single
   annotated text in the critical edition of the 1970s, and to a searchable
   electronic format of different versions. The author shows that the
   different schools of interpretation in Balzac criticism (traditional,
   semioticians, socio-critics) constructed these diverse editing
   technologies to influence the evolution of literary theories. For
   instance, traditional scholars' theory of authorship entertains en
   elective affinity with the critical edition of La Comedie humaine.
   Socio-critics challenged its assumptions and constructed electronic
   editions to develop their own theories, particularly on the genesis and
   reception of Balzac texts. By focusing on the epistemic cultures in
   which research practices are embedded, this case study complements
   purely institutionalist perspectives on knowledge-production in the
   academic field and highlights the presence of diverse epistemic cultures
   in literary criticism.

AB Change in art is all understudied topic in sociological research. This
   article examines protest artworks (arpilleras) produced by shantytown
   women during and shortly after the dictatorship in Chile, to explore the
   question Why political art that is for sale changes over time. This
   research is based oil 136 semi-structured and in-depth interviews with
   various members of the art world in Chile, Europe, and the United
   States, a year's worth of participant observation of art groups in
   Santiago and over five hundred photographs of arpilleras, taken by the
   author and analyzed thematically. Political art that is for sale call
   change because the intermediary (the organization connecting producers
   and buyers) becomes less or more politically conservative, develops a
   precarious financial situation, grows more afraid of repression, and has
   the power to enforce the changes it desires; because the original
   buyer,,; are replaced with new buyers with different motivations; and
   because new artists with new ideas begin making the art, one artist in
   the group produces something different and the idea spreads, artists
   censor themselves, and artists have new experiences or learn about new
   events. Through these sources of change, international social movements,
   local and international political and economic developments, and global
   institutions impact the art. Meanings attached to the art by the
   different parties (intermediaries, buyers, and artists) and class
   differences between artists and intermediaries are also important in
   facilitating change. These findings, based as they are oil political art
   made in a repressive context, not only contribute to our understanding
   of artistic evolution bill they help correct the bias in the sociology
   of art toward "art" made in democratic countries of the "First World."
   They are not just applicable to authoritarian regimes but also to art by
   politicized minority groups in democratic contexts, and to other
   cultural products such as newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and
   books.

AB While the influence of networks in conversion is among the most
   established findings in the sociology of religion, relatively little is
   known about how and why they have their influence. In this study the
   author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in
   network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently
   influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter
   and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, "structural
   availability" works not only by freeing an actor from
   conformity-inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative
   absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates
   individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location
   strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life
   problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number
   of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations.

AB In his popular introductory sociology text, Stark identifies W. E. B. Du
   Bois and Albion Small as important cornerstones of the U.S. sociological
   tradition. While the work of the "Chicago School" is well known in
   sociological circles, Do Bois' sociological legacy is not. The
   Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996) is a classic empirical sociological
   study that is rarely included in discussions of the development of
   scientific sociology. Likewise, The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003)
   represents one of the first empirically based sociological studies of a
   religious institution. Sociologists of religion routinely discuss the
   contributions of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel while virtually ignoring Du
   Bois. This is ironic because Du Bois' work on religion was based on
   ethnographic data, field inter-views, surveys, and census data. This
   article provides an overview of Do Bois' sociological study of the Black
   Church in the United States by identifying some of the main themes
   developed in The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996), The Souls of Black
   Folk ([1903a] 1994), and The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003). These studies
   reveal that Du Bois was a pioneer in the areas of evaluation research,
   public sociology, service learning, and congregational studies.

AB As originally developed by Charles Ragin in The Comparative Method
   (1987), qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has been used extensively
   by comparative and historical sociologists as an effective tool for
   analyzing data sets of medium-N populations. Like many other methods,
   however, QCA is a temporal and obscures the sequential nature of paths
   of causation. QCA ignores the order of events by treating combinations
   of attributes as though they occur simultaneously rather than as
   unfolding over time. While preserving the essential strengths of QCA,
   the authors present a modification that is capable of capturing the
   temporal nature of causal interactions. This modification involves a
   hybrid of Boolean algebra and sequence analysis to create a parsimonious
   set of solutions. This technique is referred to as temporal qualitative
   comparative analysis, or TQCA.

AB High school teachers of sociology have long been neglected by academic
   sociologists and the ASA. Recent developments are encouraging, however.
   In 2001, the ASA appointed a Task Force on the Advanced Placement Course
   for Sociology in High School, and Teaching Sociology has published three
   articles on high school sociology since that year. Still, there is a
   dire need for research on the characteristics and experiences of
   teachers themselves, and for empirically-based recommendations for
   assisting them. The current study uses questionnaire data to examine the
   personal and professional characteristics of the teachers who offered a
   sociology course in Connecticut public high schools during academic year
   2000-01. The results indicate that teachers have little formal education
   in sociology, are not involved in the professional activities of the
   discipline, and have virtually no exposure to sociology outside of their
   own courses. The paper concludes with recommendations for future
   research and action.

   teaching a sociology course on social control, twice under slightly
   different conditions, provide the basis for identifying the conditions
   and practices that optimize the goals of providing a forum for
   international education and enhancing reading and writing skills. A
   content analysis of the online Student-Led Discussions provides evidence
   that cross-national knowledge and understanding can be enhanced in this
   learning environment. Enrolling students from the United States,
   Belarus, Russia, and Australia, our course demonstrates how instructors
   can create a successful virtual classroom that truly encircles the

   statistical significance testing flourished in the 20th century.
   Contagion processes and the suitability of significance testing given a
   study's data characteristics encourage the diffusion of significance
   testing, whereas institutional factors such as department prestige and
   particular editorships help explain growing popularity of the. 05 alpha

AB Environmental harms involve a "double diversion" - two forms of
   privilege that deserve greater attention. The first involves
   disproportionality, or the privileged diversion of rights/resources:
   Contrary to common assumptions, much environmental damage is not
   economically "necessary" - instead, it represents privileged access to
   the environment. It is made possible in part by the second diversion -
   the diversion of attention, or distraction - largely through
   taken-for-granted or privileged accounts, which are rarely questioned,
   even in leftist critiques. Data show that, rather than producing
   advanced materials, major polluters tend to be inefficient producers of
   low-value commodities, and rather than being major employers, they can
   have emissions-to-jobs ratios a thousand times worse than the economy as
   a whole. Instead of simply focusing on overall/average levels of
   environmental problems, sociologists also need to examine
   disproportionalities, analyzing the socially structured nature Of
   environmental and discursive privileges. Doing so can offer important
   opportunities for insights, not just about nature, but also about the
   nature of power, and about the power of the naturalized.

AB Much of our knowledge about police behavior "on the street" is based on
   in-person observation of the police. However, little research has
   examined how the observers can potentially bias observational data. In
   this paper, anecdotal accounts from a variety of field settings are
   categorized into four potential sources of observer bias. Secondary
   analyses of data from a large-scale observational study of police are
   used to assess the impact of three out of the four type of observer bias
   (reactivity, going native, and burnout). There is evidence of reactivity
   for arrest, but not use of force behavior and little support for going
   native and burnout. More generally, observer bias is categorized as: (1)
   threats to the validity of observational data collected at different
   stages of fieldwork; and (2) the potential for human error implicit in
   observational data. The incorporation of a semi-structured field diary
   is suggested to more systematically document all four types of observer
   bias in future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using ethnographic research, this paper explores the experiences of
   elite women athletes on a Division-I college soccer team. I draw on
   existing literature in the sociology of sport, sociology of the body,
   and interactionism to inform my analysis. With this approach, I
   illustrate the complicated relationship women athletes have with their
   bodies in relation to physical competition and dominant notions of
   femininity today. Key reference groups influenced the players'
   self-perceptions and encouraged the women to closely monitor their own
   appearances and actions. While undoubtedly affected by these
   interactions as well as their place in the gender hierarchy, many women
   athletes subtly resisted notions of idealized bodies and constructed
   their own meanings about their bodies and experiences. Investigating the
   day-to-day body awareness and negotiations of women athletes reveals the
   gendered nuances of sport and the complicated relationship between
   cultural ideals and female embodiment.

AB This paper is an inquiry into how a new truth about sleepiness is being
   produced in a society increasingly organized around the primacy of
   expertise and its representation in print and visual media. Sleepiness
   originally described a benign, naturally occurring corporeal moment, a
   precursor to sleep. Increasingly, however, a new and disturbing meaning
   of somnolence is found in a juncture of medical and epidemiological
   research, social movements, and popular culture. Alongside the idea that
   sleepiness is a tranquil promise of repose is another, emerging truth.
   Sleepiness, we are told, is hazardous to self and others, and,
   importantly, it is each person's responsibility to resist this seductive
   call of the body. How, we ask, is a private, routinely occurring state
   of partial consciousness deprivatized, linked to public health
   vernaculars, and transformed into a reprobate condition? This
   alternative, disturbing truth about sleepiness is shown to be emerging
   from several disparate, seemingly unrelated caches of scientific
   studies, social movement literatures, magazines and newspapers, and web
   sites. The ideas of Michel Foucault, who pioneered the contemporary
   study of discourse, are shown to be particularly apropos to this
   inquiry, though not without some modification to make them more amenable
   to a contemporary society shaped increasingly by what Zygmunt Bauman
   calls "liquid modernity."

AB There has been little in-depth theoretical study in sociology of the
   motives of women and men who are childless by choice. This article
   begins to remedy this deficiency by analyzing the motives articulated by
   twenty-three childless women and men using Weber's typology of social
   action and distinction between primary and end motives. In-depth
   interview and focus group data reveal that, compared to men, women more
   often were affected by the parenting models of significant others, saw
   parenting as conflicting with career and leisured identities, and
   claimed the lack of a "maternal instinct" or disinterest in children as
   dominant influences. Men more explicitly than women rejected parenthood
   because of its perceived sacrifices, including financial expense. Both
   women and men were motivated by personality traits that they deemed
   incongruent with good parenting. Declared motives especially
   demonstrated instrumentally rational action in Weber's schema, although
   affectual and value-rational actions also were present. Respondent
   motives are compared to those that they, and empirical studies, have
   attributed to parents.

AB While the scholarship of teaching has risen in prominence in the past
   few decades, little is presently known about the structure of knowledge
   creation and dissemination in that area of scholarship. Such basic facts
   as the characteristics of programs that perform and publish the research
   (e.g., B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.), or the identities of specific schools that
   are leaders in teaching scholarship remain undocumented. This article
   explores the topic through counts of articles and notes published in a
   major outlet in the scholarship of teaching, Teaching Sociology, during
   the decade of the 1990s. We address the following: (1) Does publication
   of teaching scholarship vary by the type of degree program (e.g., B.A.,
   M.A., and Ph.D.) or by other characteristics? (2) Are some institutions
   centers of teaching scholarship? (3) How wide is the scope of teaching
   scholarship across the nation's departments? Overall, we find that a
   variety of sociology departments have established records of teaching
   publishing. Yet, some departments are leaders and appear to create a
   climate favorable to teaching scholarship.

AB I use a quasi-experiment and follow-up questionnaire to ascertain the
   effects of PowerPoint multimedia presentations and a Blackboard course
   website on the course grades and perceptions of teaching effectiveness
   of introductory sociology students. Results of t-tests showed no
   statistically significant difference in course grades between
   experimental and control groups. However, students' responses to
   standardized teaching evaluations were considerably more favorable in
   the experimental group; all measured dimensions of perceived teaching
   effectiveness yielded statistically significant increases, with
   substantial increases in perceptions of instructor rapport and grading.
   I use the ideas of George Herbert Mead to interpret the results and
   increase sociological understanding of the relationship between the
   introduction of instructional technology and student perceptions of
   teaching effectiveness. In Mead's terms, the introduction of technology
   is not merely a self-involved act performed by the instructor that
   changes the modality of course presentation but a social process
   involving both instructor and students. Within this process the
   introduction of technology is both a nonsignificant gesture, which
   elicits from students an unconscious or "instinctively" favorable
   impression of the course, and a significant symbol, which calls forth
   behavioral responses from students, conscious actions that substantially
   alter their perceptions of the course. Students not only reacted
   positively to the instructor's use of technology but through their own
   use of the technology increased their involvement in the course and came
   to perceive its teaching more favorably.

AB Africa's dismal economic performance is directly attributable to its
   weakness in the production and use of modern technology. Even Nigeria, a
   country with immense human and material resources, coupled with
   significant scientific infrastructure, has not yet been able to manage
   the all-important technological leap forward. The situation was
   different in Biafra (1967-70), when indigenous scientists and engineers
   performed socially relevant science without the preconditions
   conventionally perceived as necessary for technological development.
   Anchored in structuration theory, this article explores the sociology of
   scientific and technological practice in Biafra, outlines the
   achievements of Biafran scientists and engineers, and offers
   explanations of why the Biafran technological success has not been
   replicable in post-civil war Nigeria. Discussion concludes with a
   suggestion for development-driven geopolitical restructuring.

   often assumed to be a structurally determined process lacking human

   that middle-class social reproduction arises out of the interplay
   between agency and structure, specifically, from individuals' activation
   and negotiation of structural advantages. My analysis centers around the
   themes often invoked to illustrate working-class reproduction:
   resistance and contestation; the importance of the peer group; and
   familial structural resources-or the lack thereof. I discuss how these

AB Contemporary sociology conceptualizes religion along two dimensions: the
   institutional and the individual. Lost in this dichotomy is religion's
   noninstitutional, but collective and public, cultural dimension. As a
   result, theories of religious modernity, including both sides of the
   secularization debate, are unable to recognize or evaluate the social
   power of noninstitutionalized religious communication. This article
   offers a reconceptualization of religion that highlights its cultural,
   communicative dimension. Original research on religious talk provides an
   empirical ground for a theoretical discussion that highlights: (1) the
   "invisible" nature of religion in modern societies, as theorized by
   Thomas Luckmann and (2) the social power attributed to communication by
   contemporary cultural sociologists and cultural theorists. I argue that
   conceptualizing religion as an evolving societal conversation about
   transcendent meaning broadens the empirical and theoretical grasp of the
   religion concept.

AB Ever since Maurice Halbwachs's pioneering work, most scholars have been
   content to explore collective memory through texts and commemorative
   symbolism. Assuming that a study of collective memory has fuller meaning
   when it takes into account what ordinary people think about the past, we
   compare historians' and commemorative agents' representations of Abraham
   Lincoln to what four national samples of Americans believe about him.
   Five primary images-Savior of the Union, Great Emancipator, Man of the
   People, First (Frontier) American, and Self-Made Man-are prominent in
   the cumulative body of Lincoln representations, but recent surveys show
   that only one of these images, the Great Emancipator, is dominant within
   the public. Lincoln one-dimensional Emancipator image, which differs
   from the multi-dimensional one evident in a 1945 sample, reflects new
   perceptions of the Civil War shaped by late twentieth-century minority
   rights movements. Thus, "bringing men [and women] back in" involves
   survey evidence being added to historiographic and commemoration
   analysis to clarify one of sociology most ambiguous concepts, collective
   memory, and to explore its social and generational roots.

AB Since Durkheim pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been
   suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of
   researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a
   minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased.
   Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question
   the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From
   the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide
   accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators.
   Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to
   underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires
   positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not
   challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives.
   Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging
   of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and
   close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same
   professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in
   suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by
   determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma
   of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting
   have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article
   contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how
   a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism
   from outside parties.

AB When and how will third parties intervene in the conflicts of others?
   When will third parties further violence, and when will they foster

   The authors conducted the first systematic test of the theory, drawing
   on quantitative and qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 100
   men imprisoned for assault or homicide. Specifically, they tested
   Cooney's elaboration of Black theory, which argues (1) that the social
   location of a third party, based on ties to the principals, predicts
   whether he or she will act as a partisan or settlement agent or remain
   uninvolved, and (2) that the third-party structure of a conflict, based
   on the general configuration of all the third parties present, predicts
   whether the conflict will escalate to violence. The study results
   confirm most of the theoretical predictions regarding both third-party
   behavior and violence. The discussion also extends the theoretical
   model, offering new concepts and suggesting how the theory can be
   applied to a range of subjects, such as international war and the
   long-term historical decline of interpersonal violence.

   Novak et al.'s (1999) Just-In-Time Teaching methods, we developed online
   activities to help prepare students for subsequent in-class work and to
   cultivate a sense of group solidarity among smaller teams within the

   group learning activities was strongly predictive of better student
   academic achievement on the biweekly quizzes, cumulative final exam, and
   course paper. These findings highlight the potential value of online
   group work for fostering collaborative learning environments in large
   lecture courses as well as for enhancing student learning.

   to facilitate such pedagogical experiences, few concentrate on

   an approach, including working with a native educational institution,
   pairing sociology and Spanish students, and using home-stay families as
   informal teachers. I conclude by offering suggestions for faculty
   interested in creating a travel-study abroad course, to a developing

AB Much research in sociology and labor economics studies proxies for
   productivity; consequently, little is known about the relationship
   between personal contacts and worker performance. This study addresses,
   for the first time, the role of referral contacts on workers'
   performance. Using employees' hiring and performance data in a call
   center, the author examines the performance implications over time of
   hiring new workers via employee referrals. When assessing whether
   referrals are more productive than nonreferrals, the author also
   considers the relationship between employee productivity and turnover.
   This study finds that referrals are initially more productive than
   nonreferrals, but longitudinal analyses emphasize posthire social
   processes among socially connected employees. This article demonstrates
   that the effect of referral ties continues beyond the hiring process,
   having long-term effects on employee attachment to the firm and on
   performance.

AB Rural areas continue to face a series of challenges; many are likely to
   have profound impacts on the vitality of these places over the long
   term. Of central concern is whether the rural sociological enterprise, a
   potentially vital source of information and guidance on such diverse
   issues, will be able to effectively respond to such challenges. The
   author argues that in order to strengthen its relevance and viability in
   coming years, the rural sociological profession must embrace three
   important shifts. First, it must modify the manner in which it engages
   in the production of new knowledge by pursuing a more balanced portfolio
   of investments in disciplinary and transdisciplinary research. Second,
   it must take a bold step to build bridges to new entities whose
   missions, goals, and values closely align with those of the Rural
   Sociological Society. And third, it must take a more proactive role in
   generating quality, scientifically sound information that is aligned
   with the needs of federal and state policy communities, particularly
   information that can better articulate how policies are likely to impact
   rural people and places.

AB Trash talking has rarely been studied within sociology at a time when
   the behavior itself has been flourishing in amateur and professional
   sports. George Herbert Mead's ideas on gestures, symbols, and language,
   in conjunction with the overarching transcendency of the community aid
   in understanding the development of self and the subsequent behaviors
   that emanate from and within trash talking in college athletics. Here a
   Meadian perspective is used to explain the act of trash talking at both
   macro- and micro-levels. Three areas were identified where Meadian
   philosophy applies: (1) the game and the role of the generalized other;
   (2) play and significant communication; and (3) self-development.

AB This article considers one way to construct "analytic" narratives in
   historical sociology. The author grounds his approach in ongoing
   methodological debates over temporality and sequence in historical
   processes and the assumed trade-off between historical particularity and
   causal generality He promotes narratives that exploit both the
   sequential/ eventful and contextual properties of analytic time, with an
   approach that combines and builds on two emerging developments in
   narrative methodology: the use of rational choice theory and the idea of
   "increasing returns" in path-dependent historical processes. While doing
   narrative in this way will not be appropriate for analyzing all
   historical processes, it can be a useful methodological strategy for
   many of the questions, events, and outcomes that interest historical
   sociologists. The author draws oil his own research program on early
   equal employment law in the mid- to late 1960s to illustrate how this
   method can work in practice.

AB Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition
   that visualization fosters theoretical insight create a need for dynamic
   network visualizations, or network "movies." This article confronts
   theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social
   networks and technical questions about how best to link network change
   to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network
   movies into ( 1) static flip books, where node position remains constant
   but edges cumulate over time, and ( 2) dynamic movies, where nodes move
   as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly
   useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected
   networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples
   demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software
   program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.

AB In an agency relationship, one party acts on behalf of another. It is
   curious that a concept that could not be more profoundly sociological
   does not have a niche in the sociological literature. This essay begins
   with the economics paradigm of agency theory, which casts a very long
   shadow over the social sciences, and then traces how these ideas diffuse
   to and are transformed (if at all) in the scholarship produced in
   business schools, political science, law, and sociology. I cut a swathe
   through the social fabric where agency relationships are especially
   prevalent and examine some of the institutions, roles, forms of social
   organization, deviance, and strategies of social control that deliver
   agency and respond to its vulnerabilities, and I consider their impact.
   Finally, I suggest how sociology might make better use of and contribute
   to agency theory.

AB This paper focuses on theory in sociology. I suggest that,
   notwithstanding the benefits that accrue from the development of
   theoretical ideas and research in a competitive environment, competition
   can also have undesirable consequences. I argue that such tendencies
   should be countered by cooperation in our theoretical and research
   efforts (e.g., multimethod research). I also advocate the development of
   abstract formulations that are precise and systematic because such
   theories are more clearly understood and capable of being investigated,
   can lead to the development of more clearly defined questions, and can
   help us achieve the goal of greater cooperation. To provide an
   illustration of these points I discuss a recently developed line of
   theory and research related to "structural ritualization theory." This
   work focuses on "deritualization, "that is, the breakdown of previously
   engaged in ritualized practices due to disruptive events. Four studies
   are discussed: an experimental investigation of positive, negative, and
   neutral disruptions of ritualized practices in task groups; a study of
   personal accounts of individuals interned in concentration camps; a
   qualitative analysis of pioneering reports on disasters which shows how
   such events result in the breakdown of ritualized behaviors; and,
   historical research that focuses on "dark ages" as macrolevel
   disruptions leading to large-scale deritualization. I conclude by
   reemphasizing the value of theory and the need for cooperation,
   summarizing analytical concerns generated by deritualization research,
   and suggesting the need for applied efforts based on these principles
   and research.

AB A simulation called Star Power provides an invaluable means to help
   students understand structural social inequality. This paper explains
   how Star Power achieves this goal and provides suggestions on how to
   inculcate the following points that are both central to sociology and
   difficult to adequately convey to students: 1) Students see how those in
   power maintain their position by structuring the system to their
   advantage, 2) they learn how the structure of this system makes
   advancement for others difficult; 3) privileged students begin to
   recognize the impact of their own family's social position that they
   tend to overlook in favor of their personal effort and merit. By
   becoming more aware of structural inequalities, students realize that
   for the lower classes to join the most powerful in society, they must
   triumph over a system in which those in power make rules that protect
   their own interests, usually at someone else's expense.

AB The reciprocal connection between religion and family life makes the
   topic of religious intermarriage of particular importance in the
   sociology of religion. Spousal influences are key for motivating
   religious switching and other religious commitments. Religious
   intermarriage has also been shown to influence a host of other outcomes,
   including spousal conflict, domestic violence, divorce, and fertility.
   Using data from the 1973-1994 GSS, I estimate log-multiplicative models
   examining patterns of association between spouses' religious
   affiliations across two broad cohorts. Two-step and FIML Heckman's
   selection models are used to determine how education, migration, cohort,
   and denominational origins influence the probability of intermarriage
   and the distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Religious intermarriage
   increases across cohorts, but declines in homogamy are limited to
   liberal religious groups. Catholics and members of conservative sects
   are less likely to intermarry compared to others. The relative ordering
   of distances between religious groups was unchanged across cohorts.
   Educational attainment increases the likelihood of intermarriage, and
   marriages in which the woman has more education are more likely to be
   heterogamous. However, educational factors have no impact on the
   distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Geographically stable rural
   Southerners are least likely to intermarry and if they do, choose a more
   similar spouse. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article analyzes the anomalous case of early Title VII enforcement
   to challenge the standard political-institutional (PI) account of state
   capacity. Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement
   resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title
   VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the
   literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence
   of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies
   can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory
   construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social
   movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a
   "moving target," with state and societal actors building on legal as
   well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By
   reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced
   explanations of state policy that are both "political" and
   "institutional" and that highlight the centrality of legal
   interpretation and judicial review to political sociology.

   larger numbers of death sentences are probable in states with greater

AB Sociologists tend to eschew biological explanations of human social
   behavior. Accordingly, when evolutionary biologists began to apply
   neo-Darwinian theory to the study of human social behavior, the
   reactions of sociologists typically ranged from indifference to overt
   hostility. Since the mid-1960s, however, neo-Darwinian evolutionary
   theory has stimulated a "second Darwinian revolution" in traditional
   social scientific conceptions of human nature and social behavior, even
   while most sociologists remain largely uninformed about neo-Darwinian
   theory and research. This article traces sociology's long-standing
   isolation from the life sciences, especially evolutionary biology, to
   divergence in the metatheoretical assumptions that typify conventional
   sociological thought versus contemporary evolutionary biology. We
   conclude with a discussion of the recent emergence of a nascent

AB When examining environmental justice and injustice, surprisingly few
   studies have examined the experiences of Native Americans. In filling
   this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political
   sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the US. military
   pursues a pattern of environmental "bads" that cannot be reduced to
   capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial
   distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our
   contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we
   recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope
   conditions under which a "treadmill of production" and a "treadmill of
   destruction" are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a "treadmill of
   destruction" is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be
   reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the
   "treadmill of destruction" by examining the environmental inequality
   endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have
   collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed
   but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence
   that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such
   hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and
   won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The
   geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power
   pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of
   unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the
   dangers of this toxic legacy.

AB In the fall of 2000 the Department of Sociology at North Carolina State
   University (NCSU) implemented a Phase IV Preparing Future Faculty (PFF)
   initiative. The goal of this program was (and is) to ensure that
   doctoral students anticipating entry into a professional position be
   prepared for all expectations associated with faculty life in a wide
   variety of college and university placements. NCSUs program combined
   in-house research mentoring opportunities as well as off-campus
   mentoring relationships with faculty at other schools to explore the
   teaching and service responsibilities of junior faculty members. An
   evaluation committee assessed the effectiveness of this new initiative.
   Data were collected using several methods, including surveys,
   interviews, and focus groups. The committee found the PFF program to be
   a welcome addition to graduate training, however, the NCSU program
   experienced struggles that provide insight for other schools that may
   wish to start a PFF program of their own.

PY 2004
AB This paper discusses learning communities as pedagogy for introductory
   sociology courses, which are often plagued by student apathy. Most
   importantly, it examines the potential for learning communities to
   incorporate active and collaborative learning techniques as a vehicle to
   subvert dominant views of diversity, to see diversity as intersecting
   social inequalities that can be rearranged in favor of greater social
   equality. The effectiveness of a learning community with the theme of
   diversity for meeting these goals is assessed using qualitative and
   quantitative data. It is concluded that the pedagogic framework of the
   learning community did indeed push students to problematize their
   student role. Finally, a review of results from a pre/post-test
   questionnaire suggests that students entered the community as a fairly
   homogenous group in their views of diversity and left as a more
   heterogeneous group, indicating some shift in consciousness, however
   slight.

AB This article presents a social-organizational approach to explaining
   empirical variation in rates of altruism. The efforts of organizations
   are mostly responsible for much of the altruism seen today, and the
   substance of these efforts varies. Although research from social
   psychology and organizational studies suggests that altruistic action is
   sensitive to social context, the link between individual and
   organizational aspects of altruism has not been clearly articulated. In
   particular our knowledge of "one-shot," organizationally managed
   altruism is limited. I suggest that the factors of organizational
   resources, scope, and persistence are likely to generate higher rates of
   individual altruism in the absence of long-term relationships that
   encourage giving behavior The approach is applied to the case of
   cadaveric organ procurement in the United States. The analysis
   highlights the central role of organ procurement organizations (OPOs).
   Quantitative analysis of OPO procurement rates shows that, while
   demographic characteristics are important, OPO resources and scope are
   important predictors of procurement. The findings strongly suggest that
   the ability of organizations to produce contexts for giving explains a
   substantial amount of variation in rates of one-shot altruism.

AB This article encourages sociologists to study gender as a social
   institution. Noting that scholars apply the institution concept to
   highly disparate phenomena, it reviews the history of the concept in
   twentieth-century sociology. The defining characteristic most commonly
   attributed to social institution is endurance (or persistence over time)
   while contemporary uses highlight practices, conflict, identity, power,
   and change. I identify twelve criteria for deciding whether any
   phenomenon is a social institution. I conclude that treating gender as
   an institution will improve gender scholarship and social theory
   generally, increase awareness of gender's profound sociality, offer a
   means of linking diverse theoretical and empirical work, and make
   gender's invisible dynamics and complex intersections with other
   institutions more apparent and subject to critical analysis and change.

   topical and theoretical foci are associated with themes suggested by the

AB The growing interest in public sociologies marks an increasing gap
   between the ethos of sociologists and social, political, and economic
   tendencies in the wider society. Public sociology aims to enrich public
   debate about moral and political issues by infusing them with
   sociological theory and research. It has to be, distinguished from
   policy, professional, and critical sociologies. Together these four
   interdependent sociologies enter into relations of domination and
   subordination, forming a disciplinary division of labor that varies
   among academic institutions as well as over time, both within and
   between nations. Applying the same disciplinary matrix to the other
   social sciences suggests that sociology's specific contribution lies in
   its relation to civil society, and, thus, in its defense of human

   were salient. Firms financed through central government and bond issues
   relied less on markets. Firms funded through local government moved into
   markets faster; firms funded by banks were initially faster to markets
   but slower to markets after bank reform shifted lending policies. Thus,

AB Four decades have passed since the publication of Gerhard Lenski's The
   Religious Factor. While generally regarded as a classic in the sociology
   of religion, the book has had a curious history, largely because of the
   interest it generated in differences between Protestants and Catholics.
   In this paper I provide an alternative reading of The Religious Factor's
   impact on sociology of religion that points to its larger theoretical
   implications. I argue that the book should be understood in relation to
   continuing debates about the classification of religious traditions,
   differentiation among socioreligious groups, intergroup relations among
   religious traditions, and friendship ties within religious communities.
   Through understanding these contributions, the book's legacy as well as

   explanation in sociology was social-psychological. Moreover, by the
   1980s, the bias against biology in feminist theory came to include all

   requires consideration of constructs in addition to those developed by

   structure, I reconsider the salience of the event in the
   developmentalist project and suggest that ecological-evolutionary theory
   can be quite helpful in posing new questions about an eventful
   sociology. By rethinking communism's collapse in 1989 and terrorism's
   explosion in 2001 within Lenski's theoretical frame, one can suggest

   interviews with residents of eight communities in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico,
   impacted by Hurricane Georges in 1998, this paper shows that through
   integrating mass communication research to disaster theory we can obtain
   a more accurate picture of the media-audience relationship during
   natural disasters. In addition to the manifest functions of providing
   information, the media also have latent functions in disasters, which
   consist of emotional support and companionship. The media also help
   isolated individuals to feel connected with the "outside world." These
   functions are most salient in the impact phase of disasters. These
   functions are also particularly crucial as they have been shown to

PY 2004
AB Drawing on interviews with peer-review panelists from five
   multidisciplinary fellowship competitions, this paper analyzes one of
   the main criteria used to evaluate scholarship in the humanities and the
   social sciences: originality. Whereas the literature in the sociology of
   science focuses on the natural sciences and defines originality as the
   production of new findings and new theories, we show that in the context
   of fellowship competitions, peer reviewers in the social sciences and
   humanities define originality much more broadly: as using a new
   approach, theory, method, or data; studying a new topic; doing research
   in an understudied area; or producing new findings. Whereas the
   literature has not considered disciplinary variation in the definition
   of originality, we identified significant differences. Humanists and
   historians clearly privilege originality in approach, and humanists also
   emphasize originality in the data used. Social scientists most often
   mention originality in method, but they also appreciate a more diverse
   range of types of originality. Whereas the literature tends to equate
   originality with substantive innovation and to consider the personal
   attributes of the researcher as irrelevant to the evaluation process, we
   show that panelists often view the originality of a proposal as an
   indication of the researcher moral character especially of his/her
   authenticity and integrity. These contributions constitute a new
   approach to the study of peer review and originality that focuses on the
   meaning of criteria of evaluation and their distribution across clusters
   of disciplines.

   Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage

   practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration
   networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been
   growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline
   coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the
   sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that
   quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative
   work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given
   collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is
   consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has
   potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in

   within networks of association and social exchange-that is, it is a form
   of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs
   among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data
   on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network
   analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental
   prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view.
   Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks
   explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar
   findings are reported for history and political science. This
   alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies -
   e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity,
   the strong association between department size and prestige, and the
   long-term stability of prestige rankings - encountered in research that
   is based on the more conventional view.

AB The authors examine self-reported emotional experiences of individuals
   in a large probability sample of Americans, using two theories in the
   sociology of emotions as lenses to apprehend social order in emotional
   processes. Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals' positions in a
   three-dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith-Lovin, MacKinnon),
   the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social
   structural, circumstantial, and individual-level variables. Viewing
   emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts
   (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how
   transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and
   other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that
   emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the
   examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find
   that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience,
   structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The
   analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion
   management that may have been overlooked in other studies.

AB Sociologists have produced large, well-known literatures on inequality
   across geographic territory at two ends of the spatial scale continuum,
   within the city and across nation-states. In this paper, I discuss a
   different scale of focus, subnational stratification processes across
   middle-range spatial units, those between the city and nation-state.
   While characterizing much contemporary rural sociological research, this
   approach to spatial inequality does not tend to be seen as a coherent
   tradition that cross-cuts substantive areas. First, I discuss why
   attention to subnational inequality, rural regions, and middle-range
   spatial units are important to social science understanding of
   stratification processes. Second, I provide an overview of contemporary
   research traditions in rural sociology which, taken together, form a
   distinct and innovative approach to spatial inequality. Third, I draw
   from my own work to explain how factors affecting socioeconomic
   inequalities across middle-range territorial units may be conceptualized
   and provide two sets of empirical examples. Finally, I discuss what
   should be done in terms of furthering rural sociology's regional
   approach to spatial inequality.

AB Retail farmers' markets are seen as key institutions in a more "civic
   agriculture," but little is known about how they promote small business
   entrepreneurship. Drawing on research in economic sociology and economic
   geography, this paper examines the role of social learning in vendor
   innovation. Data from a 1999 mail survey of farmers' market vendors in
   California, New York and Iowa show that business innovation, as
   represented by intensity of vendors' innovative marketing practices and
   vendors' successful enterprise expansion, was modest. Social learning
   through engagement with customers contributed to more innovative
   marketing by vendors, while social learning through engagement with
   customers and fellow vendors increased the likelihood of vendors
   diversifying to additional markets beyond the farmers' market. Certain
   individual and enterprise characteristics also influenced vendor
   innovation. This suggests that, although important, the beneficial
   effects of social learning for vendors at farmers' markets remain
   moderated by human capital and structural factors.

AB Sustainable development demands institutions manage the conflicts and
   struggles that inevitably arise over material and ideal interests. While
   current cooperative theory privileges the economic element, a political
   economy of cooperation emphasizes cooperatives' tentative bridging of
   economic and political spheres with a democratic ethos. The
   cooperatives' democratic political structure exists in tension with a
   capitalist economic structure and other sites of friction. These
   contradictions are: in the realm of social relations, between production
   and consumption; in the realm of spatial relations, between the local
   and the global; and in the realm of collective action, between
   cooperatives as both traditional as well as new social movements. Where
   neo-classical economic models seek to eliminate or reduce these
   tensions, political economy views these tensions as functional to
   sustainability by creating an "institutional friction" that facilitates
   innovation, flexibility and long-term adaptability. This political
   economy of cooperation is intended as a step toward the development of a
   multidimensional sociology of cooperation.

AB Although there have been general social, economic, and environmental
   hypotheses developed to explain the distribution of endangered species
   across the globe, there is a paucity of social science literature
   designed to specify these hypotheses in more detail or test them with
   comparative, national-level data. This study draws on several models
   from environmental sociology to specify conceptually the relationship
   between social and economic factors and rates of endangered mammals and
   birds. Specifically, I developed hypotheses based on neo-Malthusian,
   ecological modernization, treadmill of production, and world-systems
   theory and analyzed data on endangered species, population, land use,
   economic size and growth, energy use, and industrial pollutants from one
   hundred twenty nations. The results support ecological modernization's
   position that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP per
   capita and endangerment rates, but they also indicate that GDP growth is
   associated with a monotonic increase in these rates, thus supporting a
   treadmill of production argument. Yet these relationships vary by
   world-systems position. Endangerment rates in peripheral nations are
   affected more by GDP growth, whereas rates in semiperipheral nations are
   affected more by deforestation, GDP per capita, and growth in energy use
   per capita.

AB Terrorism in its purest form is self-help by organized civilians who
   covertly inflict mass violence on other civilians. Pure sociology
   explains terrorism with its social geometry-its multidimensional
   location and direction in social space. Here I build on the work of
   Senechal de la Roche (1996) and propose the following geometrical model:
   Pure terrorism arises intercollectively and upwardly across long
   distances in multidimensional space. Yet because social distance
   historically corresponded to physical distance, terrorism often lacked
   the physical geometry necessary for its occurrence: physical closeness
   to civilians socially distant enough to attract terrorism. New
   technology has made physical distance increasingly irrelevant, however,
   and terrorism has proliferated. But technology also shrinks the social
   universe and sows the seeds of terrorism's destruction.

AB Even in an increasingly polarized climate of global policy-making, the
   ideal of "sustainable development" retains currency across a remarkably
   broad swath of the political spectrum in debating alternative scenarios
   for the future. By adapting Weber's classic categories of value spheres
   and collective rationality, I distinguish contemporary approaches to
   operationalizing the concept of sustainability and elucidate the
   practical implications of each. For some, the social, ecological, and
   economic dimensions of sustainability are synergistic components of a
   single meaningful goal, pursued by either an overarching technique or a
   unifying ethic. In contrast to these unifying models, one may conclude
   that the dimensions of sustainable development invoke values that
   inevitably conflict in any complex social interaction to derive
   strategies for collective action. Framing the concept in such terms, as
   a dialogue of values, highlights the need to adapt social institutions
   to mediate value conflict at different scales, and points to
   opportunities for engaging development debates through applied research
   on comparative governance.

AB The last decade featured the emergence of a significant and growing
   literature concerning comparative-historical methods. This literature
   offers methodological tools for causal and descriptive inference that go
   beyond the techniques currently available in mainstream statistical
   analysis. In terms of causal inference, new procedures exist for testing
   hypotheses about necessary and sufficient causes, and these procedures
   address the skepticism that mainstream methodologists may hold about
   necessary and sufficient causation. Likewise, new techniques are
   available for analyzing hypotheses that refer to complex temporal
   processes, including path-dependent sequences. In the area of
   descriptive inference, the comparative-historical literature offers
   important tools for concept analysis and for achieving measurement
   validity. Given these contributions, comparative-historical methods
   merit a central place within the general field of social science
   methodology.

AB This paper examines recent work in the sociology of culture devoted to
   providing endogenous explanations of cultural phenomena. The focus is on
   works that provide cultural explanations of cultural processes, as
   opposed to the social structural and "production of culture"
   explanations otherwise predominant in the literature. I examine three
   distinct approaches: a "post-hermeneutic" approach devoted. not to the
   question of cultural interpretation but to the issue of subjects'
   manipulation of culture in the quest for meaning; a semiotic approach
   focused on the mechanics of symbol systems; and an ecological approach
   that emphasizes the role of competition and niche density in explaining
   both cultural stasis and change. The three approaches have in common a
   general lack of interest in traditional conceptions of meaning
   (verstehen), choosing instead to focus on issues related to the internal
   structure and dynamics of cultural expression. This marks a new
   opportunity for synthesis and exploration in a field traditionally
   devoted to extra-cultural explanation of cultural phenomena. Both
   endogenous and exogenous explanations are offered for the rise of this
   new trend in the sociology of culture.

AB Durkheim hypothesized that basic categories of thought an, based on
   society as their model, and that these mental representations arise from
   participation in society's totemic rites. This proposition is evaluated
   in light of recent research on the cognitive architecture of newborns
   and infants. The evidence suggests that presocialized infants possess
   mental representations of not only the physical world but also the minds
   of others and even the sui generis quality of collectivities. This
   review concludes that the Durkheimian theory of the social origin of
   mind has little empirical support and suggests that the sociology of
   mental life needs to be radically retheorized.

   This project is developed using a three-pronged pedagogical approach
   involving critical theory, problem-based learning, and information

   course on the Social History of American Families, the method can be
   modified for a variety of courses including sociology of the family,

AB Rural sociologists are currently debating the pace and extent of
   industrialization in the dairy sector of the United States. We offer the
   perspective of historical sociology to this debate, arguing that time
   and place significantly determine the outcomes of processes such as
   industrialization. We present an historically-grounded explanation for
   the rise of industrial dairying, which first occurred in Los Angeles
   County. Beginning with the immigration of Dutch dairy farmers to Los
   Angeles (L.A.) in the 1920s, a contingent and sequential
   process-embedded within the local/California political economy-of
   exploding population growth, rapid urbanization, and skyrocketing land
   prices led to repeated geographical relocations and expansions of
   large-scale dairies during the next three decades. We conclude that
   agricultural industrialization is not inevitable but instead is the
   result of contingent factors (cultural and political-economic) as well
   as the particular sequencing of events and processes. In thus
   historicizing the industrialization debate, we seek limited, rather than
   universal, generalizations.

   should have lower incarceration rates, but the opposite should be true
   in decentralized polities with federalist political arrangements where
   mass publics have greater control over punishment. Threat hypotheses are
   assessed by examining the effects of minority presence and economic
   inequality. This study uses a panel design to examine these effects on
   imprisonment rates in 13 of the most progressive democracies from 1970
   to 1995. With the murder or overall crime rates, social disorganization,
   and additional indicators held constant, the presence of corporatist and
   federalist political arrangements explain cross-national differences in
   incarceration rates. The evidence suggests that internal racial or
   ethnic threat produces larger imprisonment rates as well. The findings
   indicate that a well-developed comparative political sociology of
   punishment should help us understand contrasts in the proportion of the
   population that is incarcerated in advanced democracies.

AB We examine how mainstream sociology has used race as an explanatory
   factor by examining papers in the American Sociological Review between
   1937 and 1999. We find a dramatic increase in the likelihood that
   sociologists will take race into account, and we suggest that
   methodological innovations are largely responsible for creating an
   environment in which it is taken for granted that analysts in many
   fields will "control for race." This pattern of usage may reinforce an
   implicit conception of racial differences that we call "broad but
   shallow," in that race is expected to matter almost everywhere, but its
   effect can be neutralized by the addition of a control.

AB In an effort to explain pro-environmental behavior, environmental
   sociologists often study environmental attitudes. While much of this
   work is atheoretical, the focus on attitudes suggests that researchers
   are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present
   research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by
   drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally responsive
   behavior. We develop an environment identity model of environmental
   behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment
   identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment
   identity and commitment to the environment identity,. We examine the
   identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion
   of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal
   that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally
   responsive behavior, but this agency is largely through identity
   processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important
   theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental
   sociology.

AB By the late 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu had become the primary public
   intellectual of major social scientific status at the head of the
   anti-globalization movement that emerged in France and in other Western
   European countries. This article discusses how Bourdieu became a leading
   public intellectual, a role that seems to contrast with his early years
   as a professional sociologist. It explores what seemed to change in
   Bourdieu's activities and outlook as sociologist and what seems to have
   remained constant. It identifies several institutional conditions that
   seemed necessary for Bourdieu to be able to play the kind of public
   intellectual role he did in his later years. Bourdieu's movement from a
   peripheral position to a central location in the French intellectual
   field, the changing character of the field itself, the growing influence
   of the mass media in French political and cultural life, the failures of
   the French Socialists in power, a cultural legacy of leading critical
   intellectuals in France, a unifying national issue of globalization, and
   the political conjuncture in 1995 all intersected in ways that opened a
   path for Bourdieu to choose new and more frequent forms of political
   action. His responses to that combination of factors at different
   moments reveal both a striking continuity in desire to preserve the
   autonomy of intellectual life and a change in view and strategy on how
   best to do that. The article concludes with a brief evaluation of
   Bourdieu's public intellectual role.

AB Robert Merton presented two, not always clearly differentiated theories
   in his seminal explorations on the social-structure-and-anomie paradigm:
   a strain theory and an anomie theory. A one-sided focus on Merton's
   strain theory in the secondary literature has unnecessarily restricted
   the power and effectiveness of Merton's anomie theory. For although
   structural strain is one way to explain why deviance occurs in the
   context of anomie, it is not the only way. We contend that scholars who
   are critical of strain theory should not automatically discard Merton's
   anomie theory, because the perspective of anomie is compatible with
   several other theories of crime and delinquency. Offering examples of
   previous integration efforts, we maintain that Merton's theoretical
   model can benefit from the input of other theories of crime and deviance
   as much as these other theoretical perspectives can fine-tune their
   models and explanations.

AB This paper explores the ethnographic technique of the focused
   revisit-rare in sociology but common in anthropology-when an
   ethnographer returns to the site of a previous study. Discrepancies
   between earlier and later accounts can be attributed to differences in:
   (1) the relation of observer to participant, (2) theory brought to the
   field by the ethnographer (3) internal processes within the field site
   itself or (4) forces external to the field site. Focused revisits tend
   to settle on one or another of these four explanations, giving rise to
   four types of focused revisits. Using examples, the limits of each type
   of focused revisit are explored with a view to developing a reflexive
   ethnography that combines all four approaches. The principles of the
   focused revisit are then extended to rolling, punctuated, heuristic,
   archeological, and valedictory revisits. In centering attention on
   ethnography-as-revisit sociologists directly confront the dilemmas of
   participating in the world they study-a world that undergoes (real)
   historical change that can only be grasped using a (constructed)
   theoretical lens.

AB A single unified frame of reference for determining how sociology should
   be taught does not exist; nor does it exist for describing the optimum
   design for instituting curricula in sociology at different colleges and
   universities. Yet patterns and themes appear to persist at particular
   institutions that reflect the influence of their peculiar historical
   development and social contexts. This perspective underlies the
   examination of sociology at Howard University since its beginning as a
   series of lectures in 1895. Four factors are emphasized: the historical
   mission of the university, the special research and intellectual
   interests of departmental faculty, with particular discussion of the
   influence of E. Franklin Frazier; the struggles of traditional
   perspectives in opposition to the need to respond to new demands in
   society, and the demand of students for new courses outside the boundary
   of the existing curriculum. While I conclude that sociology at Howard
   University has always generally exhibited major facets of mainstream
   sociology, the most enduring thematic focus in research and teaching has
   centered on problems associated with racial and social inequality.

   service-learning situations to help students connect readings such as
   those by Marx, Olin Wright, and Davis and Moore with the situation of
   social class in contemporary United States. Students were required to
   keep journals of their experiences, and their journal entries provide
   the data for this paper. Though there is considerable room for
   improvement, the data suggest that the pedagogical tools employed were
   successful in promoting a deeper level of learning around issues of
   inequality, particularly social class inequality, as it exists in the
   United States.

AB This article develops an interactive, theoretical model of emotional
   feedback and amplification. Whereas the sociology of emotions typically
   examines how affect arises, this article focuses on the aftermath of an
   evoked emotion as it evolves in ongoing interaction. I argue that
   interactions serve as a stimulus to evoke emotional responses, but as
   interactions continue, these interactions provide an additional stimulus
   that feeds back into the initial emotion, amplifying it. I articulate
   two modes of emotional feedback and amplification: spontaneous and
   managed. Spontaneous amplification is a by-product of unplanned but
   continuous interactions. In contrast, managed amplification results from
   purposeful interactions and can be initiated through either surface
   acting or deep acting. The process of feedback and amplification is more
   likely under structural and cultural conditions that facilitate ongoing
   interactions. An empirical elaboration of the model is drawn from an
   ethnographic study of "TD's Restaurant." Examining how feedback and
   amplification occur in different settings is an ongoing task for
   sociologists interested in emotions, work and occupations, mental
   health, and social movements.

AB This essay explicates the role of countersystem analysis as an essential
   mode of social inquiry. In the process, particular attention is given to
   the place of negation and the future. One underlying theme is the
   asymmetry between the negative and the positive features of social
   activities, the negative being more readily identifiable empirically
   than the positive. A corollary theme, building on the observations of
   George Herbert Mead, is: one engages the present through experience; one
   engages the future through ideas. Furthermore, as Anthony Giddens,
   Ulrich Beck, and Niklas Luhmann suggest, we in late modernity seem to be
   facing a future that is more contingent than it was in early modernity.
   After articulating the foundations of the mode of inquiry we term
   "countersystem analysis," we employ Karl Mannheim as a point of
   departure for critically surveying a constellation of
   scholars-conservatives as well as reformers-who have relied upon some
   version of countersystem analysis in addressing the future. Such an
   orientation serves to advance not only theoretical inquiry but empirical

   populations other than those studied. While definitions vary,
   discussions generally agree that experiments are lower in external
   validity than other methodological approaches. Further, external
   validity is widely treated as an issue to be addressed through
   methodological procedures. When testing theories, all measures are
   indirect indicators of theoretical constructs, and no methodological
   procedures taken alone can produce external validity. External validity
   can be assessed through determining (1) the extent to which empirical
   measures accurately reflect theoretical constructs, (2) whether the
   research setting conforms to the scope of the theory under test, (3) our
   confidence that findings will repeat under identical conditions, (4)
   whether findings support the theory being tested, and (5) the
   confirmatory status of the theory under test. In these ways, external
   validity is foremost a theoretical issue and can only be addressed by an
   examination of the interplay between theory and methods.

AB Why did! a partially bureaucratized administrative system develop in Qin
   China about two millennia before it did in European states? In this
   paper, comparative historical arguments about war and state-making are
   combined with agency theory to answer this question. The Spring and
   Autumn and Warring States eras that preceded the Qin unification of
   China created the necessary conditions for bureaucratization by
   weakening the aristocracy, creating a bureaucratic model, facilitating
   the development of roads, and providing trained and disciplined
   personnel. Comparative analysis shows that the main factor
   differentiating Qin China from other states and empires was the extreme
   weakness of the aristocracy produced by an unusually long period of
   severe warfare. Although Qin China was more bureaucratic than any other
   state or empire prior to the seventeenth century, it was far from
   completely bureaucratic. The persistence of monitoring problems
   prevented its full development, necessitating deviations such as the use
   of severe negative sanctions, the creation of redundant positions, and
   limiting bureaucratization to the top of the administrative system. The
   further development of the bureaucratic administrative system in the Han
   dynasty is also discussed.

   larger protest events and those that used confrontational tactics. Tests
   (using multinomial logistic regression) of explonations of police
   action, given police presence at an event, indicate that extreme forms
   of police action were also triggered by threatening characteristics of
   events. Events in which subordinate groups and social movement
   organizations participated were also more likely to draw police action.
   Novel contributions include the comparison of dominant explanations of
   protest policing and methods that move beyond the tradition of examining
   repression through police presence or absence.

AB This study examines the concrete modalities of the production and
   recognition of a specific logical theorem in the field of artificial
   intelligence in the 1990s. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and
   textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of
   evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the
   theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the
   draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of
   the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its
   reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and
   by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization
   of debates over and the certification of the theorem were not based on
   the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified
   responses by critics and by the author's responses to
   critiques-responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations.
   This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists
   should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a
   privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social
   forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.

AB Generalizing from the sociology of earnings attainment, we develop a
   conceptual model of social embeddedness in conventional and criminal
   activities to explain illegal earnings among criminal offenders. To
   isolate the effects of time-varying factors such as legal earnings, drug
   use, and criminal opportunities, we use data from the National Supported
   Work Demonstration Project to estimate fixed-effects models predicting
   month-to-month changes in illegal earnings. We find that criminal
   earnings are sensitive to embeddedness in conforming work and family
   relationships, criminal experience, and the perceived risks and rewards
   of crime. Moreover, heroin and cocaine use creates a strong earnings
   imperative that is difficult to satisfy in the low-wage labor market,
   and offenders earn far more money illegally when they are using these
   drugs than during periods of abstinence.

AB The incorporation of new figures to the canon of sociological theory
   creates unique challenges for the teaching of sociology. We need to
   rethink the intellectual context of such writers' contributions and
   devise new ways to involve students in these theorists' insights. This
   article suggests some of the tasks ahead in reworking our presentation
   of Erving Goffman's sociology to students. An overemphasis on Goffman's
   work on the social self in has resulted in a teaching convention that
   places him among symbolic interactionist theorists. This practice has
   obscured important linkages of Goffman's other work on social rituals
   and social forms to other theoretical traditions, most conspicuously the
   Durkheimian ritual tradition. This article depicts a useful
   participatory exercise for teaching Goffman's dramaturgical sociology
   that draws from his little-utilized essay on embarrassment and social
   organization.

AB How power is extended vertically through hierarchies and horizontally
   through industrial networks and markets is a classic issue in sociology
   that was once extensively studied by Weber. Yet it is little studied
   today. Definitions of power exclude power exercise beyond the single
   relation, as does research in exchange networks. In contrast, research
   in organizations recognizes the extension of power, but offers no theory
   to explain how it is produced or to identify the conditions which might
   further or impede it. Here the extension of power beyond the single
   relationship is called power-at-a-distance. New theory offering metric
   predictions is applied to power-at-a-distance in exchange networks. That
   theory identifies the conditions that extend power beyond the dyad and
   the conditions that tend to block that extension. Five experiments on
   contrasting structures broadly support those predictions. Relations
   between power-at-a-distance and power centralization are theorized.
   Practical problems of extending power are addressed and further research
   is proposed.

AB Karl Polanyi's 1944 book, The Great Transformation, has been recognized
   as central for the field of economic sociology, but it has not been
   subject to the same theoretical scrutiny as other classic works in the
   field. This is a particular problem in that there are central tensions
   and complexities in Polanyi's argument. This article suggests that these
   tensions can be understood as a consequence of Polanyi's changing
   theoretical orientation. The basic outline of the book was developed in
   England in the late 1930s when Polanyi was working within a specific
   type of Marxist framework. However, as he was writing the book, he
   developed several new concepts, including fictitious commodities and the
   embedded economy, that led in new directions. Because circumstances did
   not give him the time to revise his manuscript, the book is marked by a
   tension between these different moments in his own theoretical
   development. The result is that Polanyi glimpses the concept of the
   always embedded market economy, but he does not name it or elaborate it.

AB The "embeddedness'' of economic life in social relations has become a
   productive analytical principle and the basis of a penetrating critique
   of economic orthodoxy. But this critique raises another important,
   social and historical question, of how the economy became "disembedded''
   in the first place - how the multitude of transactions designated
   (somewhat arbitrarily) as economic were abstracted from the rest of
   social life and reconstituted as an object, the economy, which behaves
   according to its own logic. This article investigates the social sources
   of some innovations in economic thought that contributed to the
   emergence of the economy, particularly statistical indicators and
   mechanical models. By examining the redefinitions of the object of
   economic research developed by Irving Fisher and Wesley Mitchell in the
   1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century, I argue that the
   abstraction of the economy from the remainder of social life was a
   strategy linked to the position of these innovators within the field of
   economics, conceived as a social structure. Possessing a specialized
   scientific cultural capital, but lacking upper class background,
   contacts, and dispositions that characterized the founders of academic
   economics, Fisher and Mitchell elaborated new definitions of their
   discipline's object of study, and a new type of economic expertise.

AB Using stories of citizens' resistance to legalized authority, the
   authors propose that the act of storytelling extends temporally and
   socially what might otherwise be an individual, discrete, and ephemeral
   transaction. Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a
   social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant,
   institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized
   authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including
   symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although
   such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional
   change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific
   social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending
   the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of
   resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of
   the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance
   can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of
   power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories,
   they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social
   structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.

   Consideration of the knowledge currently available and the knowledge

   considerable opportunity for sociologists to contribute to STL within
   faculty assessment. Contributions can be made in understanding what
   constitutes STL and methods for assessing contributions in this area of

   material from the Chicago school of this tradition with only a few
   including information from the Iowa school. Thus, the ideas about
   symbolic interaction that students receive from these texts are both
   incomplete and outdated. Additionally, the inclusion of material from
   only one of these schools greatly diminishes opportunities to use
   information from the other school to help students gain a sociological
   perspective on some of the most important topics in the introductory

   traditions can be used to enhance student learning about topics central

   arise in course development, including course content similarity,

   if we must teach delinquency in addition to criminology and deviance?
   Sociology majors interested in crime and deviance are likely to take
   more than one of these sociology courses, and non-majors often take
   these courses as electives. In this paper, I offer ideas for developing
   distinct deviance, delinquency, and criminology courses, and discuss how
   to reduce theoretical and other content overlap, paper assignments,
   course readings, and departmental issues.

   development of teaching credentials as evidence of teaching
   effectiveness. Teaching credentials refer to teaching experience,
   syllabi, teaching evaluations, a teaching philosophy, and a teaching
   portfolio. Although these indicators have gained popularity among some
   graduate education programs in sociology, to what extent are they
   requested of job applicants? Our content analysis of the academic
   positions advertised in the 1999 Employment Bulletin suggests that the
   majority of departments prefer applicants with teaching experience, but
   few request specific evidence of teaching effectiveness in their job
   advertisements. Moreover, we find that research-oriented institutions

AB Despite serious methodological problems, quantitative studies of poverty
   by U.S. sociologists predominantly rely on the official U.S. measure.
   After reviewing the shortcomings of the U.S. measure, this article
   examines several theoretical and methodological advances in poverty
   measurement. After synthesizing literature on poverty measurement, I
   argue that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative
   historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute;
   (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of
   taxes, transfers, and state benefits, and (5) integrate the depth of
   poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates
   sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of
   these criteria. Due to sociology's neglect of these criteria, this
   article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval
   measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally,
   using the Luxembourg Income Study, I examine the empirical patterns with
   these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967
   to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available for
   future research.

   has contributed substantially to the sociology of organizations and
   labor markets, it has not developed a rich understanding of how career
   trajectories are influenced by the firm's competitive position in its

   power over its employees depends on its product market position and its
   sensitivity to environmental change. The greater the firm's bargaining
   power, the less the firm will be compelled to use promotions as a device
   to induce productivity. Firms occupying robust competitive positions
   should have greater bargaining power in the labor market and be less

AB In the analysis of cross-classified data, sociologists often focus on
   building flexible models for the marginal distributions of a selected
   set of variables. One strategy for achieving flexible modeling is to
   design models for telescoping marginal distributions. As an illustration
   of telescoping distributions, consider a joint distribution of four
   cross-classifying variables: occupational attainment, education level,
   race, and gender A set Of telescoping distributions would be the
   univariate occupation distribution, the bivariate occupation by
   education, the trivariate occupation by education by race, and the
   entire joint distribution. A methodology that enables the telescoping
   modeling strategy is mixed parameterization, which has its roots in the
   statistics and sociology literatures. In this article, the authors
   develop a scheme of multilevel mixed parameterization that can be
   applied to a hierarchy of marginal distributions of reducing dimension.
   An example from the General Social Survey illustrates mixed parameters
   for telescoping models.

AB Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and
   research into the connections between associations and democracy. This
   article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy
   into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds
   of associations make: to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic
   governance in various (d) political contexts? Associations enhance
   democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of
   associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills,
   offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the
   quality and equality of representation, facilitating public
   deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to
   participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all
   mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations
   are better suited to advance some contributions than others.
   Further-more, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy
   for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of
   democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations
   appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance-liberal
   minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and
   participatory democracy-are also discussed. Finally, the democratic
   priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual
   features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example,
   associations that resist government authority are more crucial than
   those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.

AB In this address I focus on sociological relativity and our discipline's
   ineffectiveness in dealing with the anomie associated with high
   modernity. I attempt to make the case for a sociology that can
   empirically distinguish between tolerance and license and can posit
   conceptions of "social justice" and "morality" as empirically
   demonstrable phenomena. After briefly discussing relevant ideas
   associated with classical sociology and recent theoretical approaches to
   the question of sociocultural relativity, I suggest that any attempt to
   deal with the issue of social justice must involve an empirically
   grounded view of universal human nature as an emergent process that
   reveals itself time and time again within the seemingly infinite
   diversity of a socially constructed world. I further suggest that the
   path to understanding emergent human nature might include an integration
   of linguistic analysis, contemporary brain research, and the quest for
   human universals. After considering the practical (and impractical)
   implications of a successful search for emergent human nature for the
   discipline of sociology, I conclude the address with a real life example
   that illustrates the essence of human species powers even in the face of
   authoritarian oppression.

AB This work draws upon previous studies of environmental inequity to
   investigate the distribution of estimated air lead concentrations across
   3,111 U.S. counties. Data for this research come from the U.S. Census
   Bureau's 1990 Census of Population and Housing: Summary Tape File 3A and
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Cumulative Exposure
   Project. Findings from OLS and WLS regression suggest that air lead
   concentrations are associated with county racial composition. Counties
   with the largest proportion of Black youth under 16 years of age (10th
   decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than
   counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the
   largest proportion of White youth under 16 years of age (10th decile =
   0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with
   the smallest proportion of White youth (1st decile = 0.13). These
   findings persist despite adjustments for urbanization, income, and
   housing values. This work proposes that the distribution of air lead
   levels has important implications for the field of sociology and the
   study of racial inequality.

AB Conceptual disagreements about higher-level thinking are prevalent in
   the education literature. The indiscriminate use of terms such as
   critical thinking, reflective thinking, and higher-level thinking has
   created unnecessary confusion. In my view, critical thinking and
   reflective thinking are distinctly different yet complementary forms of
   higher-level thinking. What, then, is higher-level thinking and why is
   it important? What is the proper attitude for this form of thinking?
   What are the most important dimensions and types of higher-level
   thinking, particularly in sociology? How should we teach higher-level
   thinking? These are some of the most important questions that will
   inform the teaching of sociology in the 21st century. This article
   addresses these questions with some examples from sociology and
   medicine.

AB The concept of subculture has long been used routinely in sociology
   despite many criticisms about the contradictory manner in which it has
   been defined and applied. One particular problem concerns the untenable
   distinction often made by sociologists between subcultures and
   countercultures; another is the implicit characterization of subcultures
   as either deviant, marginalized groups or heroic resisters against the
   hegemonic culture of global capitalism. In this paper, we attempt to
   demonstrate a method of teaching the concept of subculture to
   undergraduate sociology students that would remedy these two
   difficulties. We do this by offering working definitions of several
   terms, including common culture, subculture, idioculture, and social
   world. We conclude the paper by developing a classroom exercise to help
   students grasp the main differences between these various terms.

AB One of sociology's defining debates centers on explanations of the
   geographic patterning of suicide. this classic debate is revisited using
   techniques of spatial analysis and data for two geographies: late
   nineteenth-century French departments, and late twentieth-century U.S.
   counties. Results of the French analysis contradict Durkheim's claim
   that "imitation" plays no role in shaping the geographic patterning of
   suicide. Suicide rates for northern and southern French departments
   cluster geographically even when the clustering of multiple dimensions
   of social integration is controlled. These findings are replicated in a
   contemporary analysis of nonwestern U.S. counties. Results for the
   American West, however support the Durkheimian view that suicide
   clusters in geographic space only because important structural
   predictors of suicide, including measures,of social integration, do so
   as. well. These discrepant findings are reconciled and it is concluded
   that the geographic patterning of suicide is shaped by both social
   integration and imitation.

AB The formation of early modern states-combining increases in taxation,
   warfare, and administrative centralization-was often violently opposed
   by subjects. A game theoretic model of strategic interactions between
   rulers and subjects is developed to more fully specify the relationship
   between state-making and revolt in France between 1515 and 1789.
   Quantitative analyses of revolts throughout France are combined with a
   brief case study of revolts in Guyenne (the most quarrelsome French
   province) to test propositions derived from the model. Offensive war
   (but not war in general) and administrative centralization increased the
   likelihood of revolt, while the presence of the Estates General (the
   national legislative assembly) decreased it. The effect of taxation on
   revolt depended on the historical context-high taxes and offensive wars
   tended to incite revolts prior to the Fronde (a cluster of revolts in
   1648-1653), but had no effect afterwards. It is argued that the outcomes
   of significant revolts, like the Fronde, often serve as important
   turning points in the history of state-making. Potentially similar
   events in medieval England and early modern Spain are also discussed.

AB Racial differences in homeownership have long been a topic of
   sociological study. Previous studies, however, neglected to consider
   differences in levels of homeownership between nonmarried black and
   white women in the context of place. Accordingly this paper focuses on
   the interaction between place, race, and gender and its impact on
   homeownership for nonmarried persons. The study employs the Integrated
   Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) and logistic regression analysis to
   address the following questions: Has the racial differential in
   homeownership for nonmarried women changed from 1970 to 1990? How do
   place, race, and gender interact to determine the levels of
   homeownership for nonmarried women? The findings reveal that, although
   black women were less likely than white women to own homes, the racial
   differential declined dramatically in rural areas over the two-decade
   period. The overall trend of decline was opposite to that for urban
   areas.

   impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs;
   and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent

   organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and

AB Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered a powerful catalyst in

   East European transition countries. I compare and contrast current
   approaches, which consider country characteristics as determinants of
   FDI, with a relational approach that emphasizes institutional,
   political, economic, and cultural connections between investor and host
   countries. Regression analyses of FDI flows,in country dyads provide
   little evidence for the effects of country characteristics. Political,
   migration, trade, and cultural relations between investors and hosts
   have strong positive effects on FDI flows, and they add considerably to
   the proportion of the explained cross-national variance. These findings
   highlight the utility of a relational understanding of macroeconomic
   processes, as well as the importance of examining how substantively
   different social relations shape economic exchange.

   neighborhood effects. Neighborhood effects are community influences on
   individual social or economic outcomes. Examples include labor force
   activity, child outcomes, criminal behavior, and other socioeconomic
   phenomena. The existing theoretical and empirical literature is
   reviewed. Conceptual definitions from sociology are linked and
   contrasted with economic models. Early studies are criticized for
   failing to account for a number of endogeneity concerns. Recent
   empirical studies are also explored. The results of these papers
   demonstrate that although neighborhood characteristics are important,
   their influences are much smaller than suggested by previous research.
   An additional emphasis is dedicated to linking the neighborhood effects
   literature to other research of local or spatial activity within
   economics, sociology, and geography. In particular, the potential
   employment of local interaction game theory and spatial econometrics in
   neighborhood effects research is discussed. Additionally, a catalogue of
   existing empirical research is assembled. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

AB Max Weber has typically been regarded as a central thinker in the
   liberal tradition of social analysis. At the same time, critics have
   long noted how his democratic commitments were compromised by his
   nationalism. Drawing on existing criticism, I discuss the importance of
   charismatic leadership in Weber's thought and its implications for his
   understanding of the process of democratization. Reconstructing core
   concepts in Weber's political thought, I analyze how Weber's concept of
   plebiscitarian leadership unites charismatic domination with nationalism
   and skepticism concerning effective democratic politics. I show how
   Weber's concept of plebiscitarian rule grew from deeply held political
   values and his engagement with German politics. I then generate
   propositions regarding the problem of democratization in regime
   transitions and apply them to contemporary charismatic leaders and
   ethno-nationalist mobilization in post-Communist transitions. T argue
   that as much as it anticipates the central dilemma of charismatic
   solutions to political crisis, Weber's thought favors nationalist and
   plebiscitarian responses to democratization that have been largely
   discredited by historical experience.

   objective value-free knowledge positivism entailed in the past versus a
   self-reflexive quest for knowledge that entails a tragic acceptance of
   its limits at present. (2) the effort to distinguish social theory from
   sociology, ideology. and politics, with all of whom it overlaps as they
   strive to be both social diagnosis and social therapy. (3) the
   production of knowledge as dependent both on the lived experiences that
   shape our biographies and on the intellectual influences available in
   the local settings where we work, (4) the effort to warn us against the
   various excesses to which our disciplinary and personal commitments give
   way, and (5) the role social theory can play as a search light that
   illuminates our way in the darkness of the empirical world in which we
   live, while it simultaneously casts a shadow.

   vision existed during Gouldner's early career as a standout in the field
   of industrial sociology and that this tragic vision became manifest
   around 1962 as Gouldner was developing more and more strident
   denunciations of establishment sociology. This case study of Gouldner's
   career teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the tragic
   vision in helping sociologists to understand the limitations of the

   The coming crisis of Western Sociology. the earlier book has suffered
   neglect. In an effort to correct this situation, we situate Enter Plato
   against the backdrop of other mid-twentieth-century works in the
   sociology of knowledge and related areas, arguing that Gouldner's study
   was one of the first sustained responses to Robert K, Merton's call for
   a sociology of knowledge that would steer a middle course between the
   abstract, speculative tendencies of the field's European founders and
   the relatively atheoretical contributions of their American
   counterparts. We build on this interpretation to offer a contemporary
   sociological appraisal of Enter Plato, considering its positive and
   negative lessons for sociologists of knowledge and ideas at the present

AB The movement to assess student learning more comprehensively and more
   systematically began in earnest in the mid-1980s, and today is
   entrenched throughout higher education. However, commentary about
   assessment continues to be dominated by anecdotal reports and analyses
   of the strengths and weaknesses of particular programs. In order to
   obtain a broad-based picture of the development of assessment programs
   within sociology, 150 sociology departments were randomly selected and
   sent a self-administered questionnaire regarding the level of
   development of their departmental statement of purpose, departmental
   goals and objectives, the use of and experience with particular
   assessment mechanisms, and a summative judgment about the amount of work
   invested in assessment to date and the effects of that work.
   Almost two-thirds of the 70 responding departments have a departmental
   statement of purpose, but only about half of the departments have
   articulated specific learning objectives for students. Departments in
   public institutions are much more likely than departments in private
   institutions to have a statement of purpose and are somewhat more likely
   to have learning objectives. The most common assessment mechanisms being
   used are evaluations of specific assignments in required major courses,
   student surveys, alumni surveys, external reviewers, and evaluations of
   research projects. However, the most beneficial mechanisms are perceived
   to be reviews by external evaluators, work in a capstone course,
   in-house comprehensive exams, and in-house exams given early and late
   during a student's progression through the sociology major. Responding
   institutions reported that they have dedicated only a moderate effort to
   their student learning assessments and that the information received
   from those assessments has provided only moderate value. The
   implications of these assessment patterns found in sociology departments
   are discussed.

   assessing student learning at a community college using critical
   theories of knowledge and the learning process. The faculty-designed
   assessment program includes an annotated bibliography assignment
   required in all introductory sociology sections. Faculty identified
   three types of literacy that students were expected to understand and
   practice as a result of the assignment: resource, social structural, and
   social scientific. Student learning in these areas was tracked across
   semesters using a survey, faculty observations, and sampled evaluations
   of completed bibliographies. All measures of learning indicate
   significant improvement in learning outcomes. The article records and
   discusses the program methodology within the framework of critical
   pedagogical theory.

AB In this paper, we present a strategy for the curricular design and
   assessment of one multidisciplinary program goal (understanding human
   behavior). We show how assessing a desired outcome requires attention to
   four specific areas: organizational context, the articulation of a
   learning model, program design and implementation, and outcomes
   assessment. Our findings, based on multiple indicators gathered over
   time and including both summative and formative measures, suggest that
   our graduates are generally achieving the outcomes established for them.
   We discuss how our results are used to inform decision-makers, and how
   inconsistencies discovered between the program's desired outcomes and
   students' actual achievements are managed within the framework of the
   program. Finally, we highlight several lessons learned as a result of
   this intensive process, linking its benefits to programs within
   sociology and other disciplines.

   assessment, but rather a "sociology of assessment" describing how we
   implemented a less-than-ideal design, under numerous constraints, with
   mixed results. We describe different assessment designs available for
   different types of curricula and report results from a
   quasi-experimental design comparing the level of critical sociological
   reasoning skills between students near the beginning and those finishing
   their studies. Those students finishing their program, organized as a
   loosely-spiraling curriculum with a capstone course, displayed stronger
   sociological reasoning skills even when controlling for each student's
   overall GPA. An analysis of course syllabi revealed an academic
   environment with variable standards inconsistently associated with
   course level. Several recommendations are offered for the "real world"
   implementation of sociology curriculum assessment. We think the
   multi-dimensional diversity within sociology presents the greatest
   obstacle to both designing and assessing sociology curricula.

AB Building on Helen MacGill Hughes's News and the Human Interest Story, we
   examine how human interest stories create collective attention,
   essential for the establishment of a public or demos, and the
   limitations of that process. Although human interest stories are not
   unique in this regard, such stories encourage shared identification,
   important for social cohesion and the maintenance of a public sphere.
   However, since the embedded story is presented as one that is not
   perceived as having lasting societal impact, it directs attention away
   from political action. We present four processes through which human
   interest stories operate. (1) media placement - how media structure and
   occupational interests produce stories that capture reader loyalty, (2)
   identification potential - the creation of scenes and personae that
   audiences feel they "know" and with which they can identify, (3)
   narrative arc - the process by which a story maintains reader interest,
   exposing conflicts and changes in likely outcomes, and (4) discursive
   space - the role of moral issues, provoking discussion and the
   possibility of active involvement of audiences. To explore these
   processes we analyze the case of Floyd Collins, the Kentucky caver
   trapped for seventeen days in 1925, and detail the associated media
   frenzy.

AB At century's end, a combination of telecommunications and computer
   technologies has resulted in the creation of the Internet, a global
   network of computers that has been growing at an exponential rate.
   Although the Internet/World Wide Web combination is widely hailed as a
   new, powerful engine of global social and economic change, there has
   been very little sociological theorizing and even less sociological
   research on the globalization of the Internet. Using classical
   macrosocial theories of development as a springboard, we hypothesize
   that the level of development, political openness/democracy, mass
   education, the presence of a sizeable tertiary/services sector, and
   interactions between some of these variables will drive the Internet's
   growth and spread around the globe. In our cross-national analysis of
   approximately 74 developed and developing countries, we find that
   Internet capacity is not in fact a simple linear function of economic
   and political development, but rather has been driven by complex
   interactions that could aptly be termed "post-industrialism." Uncovering
   some of these structural preconditions and determinants of Internet
   diffusion provides a first step toward providing a theoretical and
   empirical sociology of this "third technological revolution." (C) 2002

AB Postmodern social theory is often seen as entirely distinct from and

   to challenge this framing by tracing the emergence of postmodernist
   social thought to a historical development in Western societies
   intimately tied to the conditions of emergence of modern sociology, that
   is, to the crisis of the loss of the sacred for the modern intellectual
   class. Postmodern theory is linked to two Purportedly opposed schools of
   modern social thought, Durkheimianism ami Bergsonianism by demonstrating
   the careful concern in each of these strands for a renovation of the
   sacred in the wake of the devastating effects Enlightenment and
   materialist thought had on traditional modes of the sacred for
   intellectuals (if not for larger segments of Western societies).
   Explicit textual evidence of this influence is also examined.

   methods of research unsophisticated and of low quality, and that they
   omitted theory from their analyses. The findings of this investigation
   indicate that the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory utilized a

   content and instructional materials, they have failed. I argue that a
   new approach is necessary, one that focuses on improving high school
   sociology teacher training. Professional associations and academic
   departments must both contribute to efforts to improve the formal
   sociological education and professionalization of high school teachers
   of the discipline. Improving teacher training is the best way to enhance
   the quality of secondary sociology courses, and may also help rectify
   the discipline's distorted public image as high school students gain a
   more accurate appreciation and understanding of fundamental sociological
   insights from their better trained teachers.

AB A crucial task of introductory sociology courses is to teach students
   the meaning and value of the sociological imagination. While this task
   is daunting under typical circumstances, it is more difficult when
   instructors are committed to raising students' critical awareness of
   social conventions that maintain systems of racial oppression. In this
   paper, we discuss our experiences with teaching this aspect of the
   sociological imagination to a group of ethnically and economically
   privileged students. Based upon our experiences and existing research,
   we propose that a rise in students' political conservatism and their
   adoption of color-blind racism may explain our students' recalcitrance
   and the increasing reports of resistance from those who teach race and
   inequality courses. We provide details of an assignment that eased
   students' recalcitrance by enabling them to demonstrate to themselves
   the fallacies of scientific racism. The assignment, a critical
   assessment of Rushton's scathing review of "Gould's Mismeasure of Man, "
   required students to exercise their sociological imagination to
   successfully unmask the agendas, fallacies, and consequences of
   "scientific racism." Quotes from the students' assignments and the
   course evaluations show that the assignment conveys to recalcitrant
   students the utility of sociological analysis.

AB This article draws on the preceding seven histories of national
   associations to examine commonalities and differences among them. The
   histories portray different strategies of organizing associations and
   adapting themselves to state control, societal conditions and members'
   interests. A disciplinary model was the most prevalent organizing
   strategy, but its viability ebbed and flowed with political oppression,
   the state of sociology as a discipline and internal associational
   conditions such as disciplinary composition and dissension. Two of the
   seven associations have survived continuously since being founded, while
   the other five have perished and been reborn from one to five times.
   Political oppression and internal associational dissension are what are
   mainly responsible for these associational deaths; for the state of
   sociology and its place in the academy for rebirths; and for the
   organizational cooptation of member interests for associational survival
   and growth.

AB Reputational change can occur both posthumously and within a person's
   lifetime. Championed by reputational entrepreneurs, reputations emerge
   from competitive fields of interpretive possibilities. The purification
   of Pete Seeger's image, from vilified Communist to national hero, lets
   us study both reputational change and the relationship between art and
   politics. An objectivist model suggests that reputations simply reflect
   truth. An ideological model claims that Seeger's redemption is shaped by
   a biased media. Neither sufficiently explains the competitive nature of
   reputational politics. Our constructionist model takes into account both
   the role of reputational entrepreneurs and the structural constraints
   they face. We chart Seeger's reputation through four historical periods:
   recognition among his peers on the Left (1940s), ruin in the McCarthy
   period (1950-62), renown among sympathetic subcultures (1960s), and
   institutionalization as a cultural icon. While it has clear advantages,
   institutionalization can also have a dampening effect on an artist's
   oppositional potency.

   that existing scholarship differences between males and females in this

   throughout the career as a result of different employment patterns and

AB American immigration has long been characterized by spatial
   concentration within major urban areas. Los Angeles and New York City
   are two of the most important immigrant meccas today. Recent studies of
   immigrant adaptation within these cities have emphasized material
   factors at the expense of cultural considerations. This paper adopts a
   comparative perspective to demonstrate extreme differences in the
   symbolic construction of identity vis-a-vis immigrants in these two
   urban areas. Using The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times as
   indicators of elite cultural orientations, a content analysis is
   performed. The results demonstrate the social construction of an
   exclusive "threat" narrative in Southern California, and an inclusive
   "immigrant as victim" narrative in the New York metropolitan area. I
   argue that this extreme variation in cultural orientations must be
   understood as the result of divergent material and symbolic contexts. In
   order to demonstrate the importance of cultural factors, this paper
   focuses on symbolic differences between these areas and the influence
   these differences have on the political process of inclusion/exclusion.

AB The specialized field of disaster studies seems to be moving farther
   away from mainstream sociology, to the detriment of both. For
   sociologists working in this field, application of Max Weber's political
   sociology is proposed as one way to reconnect their research with
   longstanding concerns of the discipline. Weber's political sociology
   contains a conflict model focusing on structured inequalities of class,
   status, and power. Its relevance to both contemporary sociology and

AB It has long been assumed in sociology that gender differences in
   religiousness are a product of differential socialization. Yet, there is
   little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the
   literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the
   relationship between differential socialization and differential
   religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World
   Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between
   traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs
   and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the
   two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model
   involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new
   approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being
   irreligious constitutes risk-taking behavior. This model is able to
   predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and
   cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB One of the most widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been
   how to interpret patterns of family change in the United States during
   the past four decades. Much of these debates focus on a thesis advanced
   by a number of scholars and political activists-that such features of
   family structure as high divorce rates and an increasing proportion of
   single-parent families have led to the decline of the family. Although
   past research has examined the causes and historical trends involved in
   family change, scholars have neglected important questions about family
   attitudes that have been raised in recent debates. Have levels of public
   concerti with family decline increased over time? If so, what are the
   sources of these attitudes? And have changing levels of public concerti
   with family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage?
   This study applies a theory of religious influence to answer these
   questions. Results show that public concern with family decline
   increased steadily after 1980, leading to a new and increasingly large
   cleavage in presidential elections. The analyses also find that high
   levels of concern with family decline are concentrated among evangelical
   Protestants who attend church regularly. In addition to extending
   sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions,
   these results bear productively on theory and research in political
   sociology and the sociology of religion. I discuss their relevance to
   long-standing debates over political trends among evangelical
   Protestants and the influence of Christian Right movement organizations.

AB The recent literature on immigrant transnationalism points to an
   alternative form of economic adaptation of foreign minorities in
   advanced societies that is based on the mobilization of their
   cross-country social networks, Case studies have noted the phenomenon's
   potential significance for immigrant integration into receiving
   countries and for the economic development in countries of origin.
   Despite their suggestive character, these studies consistently sample on
   the dependent variable (transnationalism), failing to establish the
   empirical existence of these activities beyond a few descriptive
   examples and their possible determinants. These issues are addressed
   using a survey designed explicitly for this purpose and conducted among
   selected Latin immigrant groups in the United States. Although immigrant
   transnationalism has received little attention in the mainstream
   sociological literature so far, it has the potential of altering the
   character of the new ethnic Communities spawned by contemporary
   immigration. The empirical existence of transnationalism is examined on
   the basis of discriminant functions of migrant characteristics, and the
   relative probabilities of engaging in these kinds of activities is
   established based on hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications
   for the sociology of immigration as well as for broader sociological
   theories of the economy are discussed.

   consider in the preliminary planning of a community-based learning (CBL)
   project. The questions are relevant to most CBL projects, ranging from
   internships to research projects and field trips, The questions include:
   Among the goals of the project, are there primary and secondary goals or
   are the goals given equal weight? Is participation in the project
   mandatory or voluntary? Should the CBL component of a course be
   concentrated in one site or dispersed across many sites? How similar or
   different should each student's individual participation in the project
   be? How central should direct client/community interaction be to
   students' activities? Based on a review of the CBL literature in
   Sociology and feedback from the students and partner organization in our
   own CBL project, we discuss each question and outline some of the
   advantages and disadvantages of various decisions, focusing on the
   competing interests of students, instructors, and partner organizations.
   The aim is not to advocate one kind of project or design over another
   but rather to help other project planners anticipate and avoid pitfalls
   noted in the literature and maximize the benefits of CBL.

   introductory level where many students find it hard to understand social
   structure and how it shapes their lives. This paper provides an
   empirical evaluation of whether an active-learning exercise focused on
   mate selection increases student understanding of the impact that social
   structure has on marital choice. I fielded the experiment in an
   introductory sociology course-half the class participated in the
   active-learning exercise while the other half attended a traditional
   lecture. Results indicate that those who participated in the exercise
   were significantly more likely to learn the role that social structure
   plays in mate selection.

   1998-99 at a mid-sized public university in the Pacific Northwest. A
   methods-based capstone is particularly valuable. By linking a course on
   research methods to a community-based learning project, students receive
   hands-on experience in using the method that they are studying in the
   classroom. The course is broken down into twelve elements, with student
   comments illustrating each class element, and a timeline for the course

AB Using a quasi-experimental design, this case study outlines the author's
   application of specific techniques necessary to implement a service
   learning component in an introductory sociology class. It also
   systematically compares the outcomes from two groups of students, one of
   which was involved in relatively unstructured community work and the
   other in a structured service learning assignment and examines the
   benefits experienced from this transformation. Although adding the
   structure necessary to accomplish effective service learning involved
   careful preliminary reflection, planning, and coordination, the study
   suggests that the service learning approach enhances students'
   development of a sociological orientation and understanding of
   structural linkages to poverty. It also indicates that students involved
   in structured service learning may better master course materials than
   students involved In less-structured community work, as measured by
   objective examination. Finally, the study supports earlier claims
   reported in the literature that service learning might be a particularly
   effective way of improving the efficacy of introductory sociology
   courses.

   theory of European integration focusing on the case of the European
   Community, the first pillar of the European Union. Traders, organized

   produced a self- sustaining causal system that has driven the
   construction of the European market and polity. The generality of this

   sector than in the state sector, the effects of education on earnings
   arc weaker in HPFs than LPFs within the state sector. The inconsistency

   necessary to explain the social problem of domestic violence. I begin by
   demonstrating the existence of competing explanations for the question

   explanation, multiple victimization arguments that emphasize the
   numerous ways battered women are victimized, are most common. Through an
   analysis of social science citations, news papers, and legislative and
   judicial decisions, I conclude that one multiple victimization argument
   in particular Lenore Walker's battered woman svndrome (Walker, 1979, The
   Battered Woman. New York: Harper Row; Walker, 1984, The Battered Woman
   Syndrome. New York: Springer), has become the most recognized
   explanation for why abusive relationships continue. The syndrome was
   best able to meet the criteria necessary, for gaining cultural
   authority, put forth by, Schudson (1989, Theory, and Society,
   18:153180): retrievability, rhetorical force, resonance, resolution, and
   institutional retention. In recent,ears, however this authority, has
   been threatened as social and cultural conditions have changed, leaving
   competing understandings of the domestic violence issue to challenge
   Walker's claims.

AB Are the politics of economic regulation contingent on institutions?
   Drawing on arguments about institutional mediation and the institutional
   bases of rational action, we explore how institutions shape the dynamics
   invoked in two theories of regulation. We argue that institutional
   arrangements affect both the clarity and the content of group interests
   in regulation. Event history analyses of U.S.. states' passage of fire
   insurance regulation from 1906 to 1930 support these arguments in
   several ways. Market-heterogeneity dynamics specified by cartel-capture
   theory affected the passage of regulation only under some
   conditions-namely, relatively depoliticized settings with little overt
   conflict or uncertainty about policy outcomes. In addition, interest
   group dynamics were conditioned by the consolidation of
   interorganizational fields around a particular model of market order,
   which allowed divergent interest groups to converge in support of
   regulation. The research suggests ways of thinking about theoretical
   generality and specificity, regulatory politics, and the relationship
   between institutional theory and rationality.

   to resolve these seemingly incompatible perspectives. By extending
   Randall Collins's interaction ritual theory, and synthesizing it with
   Norbert Wiley's model of the self this paper suggests how the emotional
   dynamics between people and within the self can explain social inertia
   as well as the possibility for resistance and change. Diverging from
   literature on the sociology of emotions that has been concerned with
   individual emotional processes, this paper considers the collective
   level in order to explore how movement action is motivated. The
   emotional dynamics of subordinate positioning that limit women's options
   in face-to-face interactions are examined, as are the social processes
   of developing feminist consciousness and a willingness to participate in
   resistance work. Pointing toward empirical applications, I conclude by

AB Despite the interest in the death penalty, no statistical studies have
   isolated the social and political forces that account for the legality
   of this punishment. Racial or ethnic threat theories suggest that the
   death penalty will more likely be legal in jurisdictions with relatively
   large black or Hispanic populations. Economic threat explanations
   suggest that this punishment will be present in unequal areas.
   Jurisdictions with a more conservative public or a stronger
   law-and-order Republican party should be more likely to legalize the
   death penalty as well. After controlling for social disorganization,
   region, period, and violent crime, panel analyses suggest that minority
   presence and economic inequality enhance the likelihood of a legal death
   penalty. Conservative values and Republican strength in the legislature
   have equivalent effects. A supplemental time-to-event analysis supports
   these conclusions. The results suggest that a political approach has
   explanatory power because threat effects expressed through politics and
   effects that are directly political invariably account for decisions
   about the legality of capital punishment.

   of their degree of consensus (the degree to which all group members
   agree) and their degree of "tightness" (the degree to which holding some
   belief implies holding or not holding other beliefs). Two theoretical
   claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal
   properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to
   produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of
   authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The
   clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as
   an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order
   translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs.
   These claims are tested with data on 44 naturally occurring communities.

AB The standard for what passes as scientific sociology is derived from
   classical physics, a model of natural science that is totally
   inappropriate for sociology. As a consequence, we pursue goals and use
   criteria for success that are harmful and counterproductive. Even those
   dismissing such efforts use the standards of physics as grounds for
   their objection. Although recognizing that no natural science can serve
   as an automatic template for our work, we suggest that Darwin's work on
   evolution provides a far more applicable model for linking theory and
   research since he dealt with obstacles far more similar to our own. This
   includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather
   than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse
   data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number
   of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction
   as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability
   to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it
   and in its development. Other sciences are briefly cited as well, but
   the main emphasis is on the lessons that Darwin provides for social
   sciences such as sociology that obtain their evidence primarily from
   non-experimental sources.

   to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how
   simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but
   enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information,
   emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in
   collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly
   and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in
   revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide
   theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than
   the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the
   emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical
   model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a
   brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in
   computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs
   fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We
   then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social
   structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology
   has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new
   methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the
   papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social
   networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs
   are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological
   theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology,
   social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with
   a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological
   potential of this approach.

   claim and proposes that, possibly, the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory
   (1896-1924) deserves the designation of being America's first school of
   sociology. Martin Bulmer's (1985) model of a school is applied to the
   Atlanta Sociological Laboratory and the findings indicate, per Bulmer's
   prerequisites, that the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory qualifies for
   school status nearly 20 years prior to the development of the Chicago
   School of Sociology.

AB Changes in U.S. environmental policy direction under the Bush
   Administration reflect two interdependent trends that have emerged over
   the past two decades: an increased capability among corporations to
   shape public policy to benefit their narrow interests, and a marked
   decline in the efficacy of democratic forces to defend progressive
   environmental policy. This article theorizes key aspects of
   antienvironmental thought and practice-facets include scientific
   production, civil-political societal relations, interclass coalition
   building, procorporate propaganda, and domination of opposition-to
   demonstrate the existence of a coordinated countermovement. The theory
   is guided by a political sociology adapted from the method of Antonio
   Gramsci that comprehends policymaking in terms of material interests
   without reducing human agency to structural imperative. Evidence
   marshaled to support the theory is gathered from the antienvironmental
   literature, public relations product, and information on political and
   economic affiliations between and among antienvironmentalists and their
   organizations.

   theoretical tools necessary for us to meaningfully integrate research,

   the Holocaust-one grounded, for example, in the study of collective
   behavior and social movements, in the study of social groups and group
   dynamics, in the interaction of structure and agency, and in the study
   of the social constructions of group identity. Examples drawn from
   several sociology courses are used to illustrate how the "sociological"
   can be integrated in the study of genocide and the Holocaust and how the
   study of the Holocaust can be integrated into our study of the
   "sociological.".

AB This paper examines the relationship between rural socialization and
   hunting participation. Assessments of the cultural significance of
   hunting as a "way of life" in rural areas echo traditional assertions of
   the importance of rurality, but do not consider the interplay between
   rural residence and other variables that affect hunting participation.
   Although previous research has demonstrated that rural residents are
   more likely to participate in hunting, as are males and those who are
   influenced by family, the interaction of these variables is poorly
   understood. A national survey used a socialization framework to explore
   the more specific conditions under which rural upbringings were
   associated with increased hunting participation. Rural upbringings
   fostered air increase in hunting primarily when the socialization
   relationship between agent and target was unlikely to do so and when
   participation was consistent with gender norms: rural males whose
   fathers did not hunt were more likely to hunt than urban males whose
   fathers did not. In no other cases did rural upbringings result in an
   increased propensity for hunting. Therefore we suggest that broad
   statements about the cultural significance of hunting to rural life be
   made more cautiously, with the effects of other variables taken into
   account.

AB Returning to themes of Land (1971a) and Land (1971b), this article
   addresses topics informal sociological models and the definition,

   standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary
   sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This
   demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many
   formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every
   scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and
   model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation
   of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment
   of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate,
   and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These
   studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that
   otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in
   particular, define and interpret social indicators.

AB Is the new paradigin in the sociology of religion, known commonly as the

   upon how one interprets current deviations from the paradigin's
   predictions. This article investigates two cases in postcommunist
   Europe, Poland and East Germany, which appear to contradict a simple
   core hypothesis of the new paradigin. We argue that these anomalous
   cases are opportunities to examine and potentially extend the
   explanatory range of the new paradigin. Ultimately, we conclude that
   these cases can be shown through closer analysis to fit with the
   underlying logic of the new paradigin and thereby argue for the theory's
   continued evaluation and augmentation.

   sociologists. In an effort to generate greater domestic interest in the

   more social than making music, and the domestic sociological community's
   absence from the debate is deplorable given the dominant position our
   country possesses regarding musical production. Weber's Sociology of
   Music, which combines urban theory, class/labor theory, rationalization
   theory, and even climatic changes, is an excellent place to begin a
   thorough discussion of the social components of music. Our present
   understanding of cultural theories, urban theories, and Habermas's
   Communicative Action Theory can be employed to improve on Weber's
   theory; toward a new approach for the study of the sociology of music.

   test students. But do students approach tests from the same orientation

   authors created and administered the Luck and Superstition Questionnaire
   to 426 students taking Introduction to Sociology. We found that nearly
   70 percent of students indicate some level of test-related superstitious
   practice. However, we also found that superstitious practice was largely
   unrelated to religious belief and practice, gender and race, educational
   performance and grade expectations, and end-of-semester pressures. These
   results are entirely consistent with Colin Campbell's theory of modern
   superstition. Superstitious practice in modem society is
   self-sustaining-not integrated into social institutions or systems of
   belief-and only "half-believed" by the very practitioners of modern

AB Although significant social progress characterized the twentieth

   encouraging complacency about social problems. In four paradoxical ways,
   progress raises concern about social problems. The paradox of
   perfectionism is that optimistic beliefs in social perfectability
   highlight failures to achieve perfection and thereby foster pessimism.
   The paradox of proportion is that reducing large problems makes smaller
   problems seem relatively larger. The paradox of proliferation is that
   social progress encourages recognition of a larger number of problems.
   Finally, the paradox of paranoia is that progress fosters fears of
   social collapse. Sociologists need to consider the consequences of

AB Bringing sociological theory and research to bear on the "quota debates"
   dogging discussion of federal civil rights legislation in the early

   law and shows how apparently technical legal arguments about allocating
   burdens of proof affect labor market resource allocation among the
   classes, races, and genders. Contrasting institutional-sociological with
   liberal-legal concepts of discrimination, the article shows why
   disparate impact theory has been the most sociological approach to Title
   VII enforcement. It also shows how disparate impact-a theory and method
   for establishing legally cognizable employment discrimination injurious
   to women and minorities-is, and is not, related to affirmative action-a
   policy encompassing a broad range of procedures intended to provide
   positive consideration to members of groups discriminated against in the
   past. Finally, a competing incentive framework is used to show that,
   although disparate impact creates some incentives for employers to adopt
   quota hiring, such incentives are counter-balanced by major incentives
   working against race- and gender-based quotas. Major counterincentives
   stem from disparate impact itself, from other aspects of equal
   employment law, and from organizational goals shaping business response
   to the legal environment.

   Weber's concept of verstehen. According to Levine, the understanding of
   subjective meaning is the most important theme of thinkers whose ideas
   resulted in the founding of sociology in Germany. Visions is more than a
   history of sociological theory, its broadest purpose being to stimulate
   a dialogue among competing "narratives" that will reduce the
   fragmentation in contemporary sociology and also address the moral
   dilemmas in contemporary society. This dialogical purpose provides a
   criterion for selecting ideas that best represent the various
   sociological traditions. Considering Weber in the context of Levine's
   book will not only clarify the German tradition but will also lead to
   both support and criticism of his dialogical thesis.

   of particular issues the critics raise are addressed by the book's
   arguments regarding the relation of the discipline of sociology to its
   philosophical background, the international setting of early sociology,
   Durkheim's individualism, Weber's distinction between naturalism and
   interpretability, Marx's treatment of Feuerbach and of nationalism, and
   the relation between power and knowledge. This response concludes by
   explicating the proposal that the time may be ripe to rejoin a number of
   the elements of Aristotelian social science that had been delegated to
   various national traditions of social theory in the modern era.

AB The strategies that Russian and American banks use to evaluate the
   creditworthiness of prospective credit card holders are compared.
   Drawing on Knight's theory of risk and uncertainty, the authors argue
   that uncertainty, inherent in any credit transaction, can only be
   reduced to measurable risk if there are institutions that create
   stability over time, categorize events properly, and allow for
   verification and accumulation of information. In the United States, the
   gradual evolution of institutions underpinning rational calculation
   permits the transformation of uncertainty into risk. In Russia, however,
   such institutions are absent, and a great degree of uncertainty prevails
   in consumer credit. Using data from original fieldwork in Moscow, this
   study demonstrates that when actors face uncertainty and are unable to
   calculate risk, they rely on trust. Russian banks use and extend their
   existing social ties, or in some cases build new ties. They also exploit
   cardholders' own networks, unrelated to the bank, to increase their
   accountability through anchoring. These strategies, however, keep the
   market embedded, limited in size, and uninsurable. The authors conclude
   that calculation of probabilities (and economic rationality in its
   formal sense) is not an innate human ability but a social capacity that
   exists courtesy of institutional arrangements.

   learning environment in order to facilitate particular learning
   outcomes. However, instructors may not realize the extent to which the
   institutional context and learning environment affect their identity and
   pedagogy as teachers. Using our experiences as two very similar
   instructors with nearly identical training currently teaching in very
   different institutional contexts (a large Midwestern Research I
   institution and a small West coast experimental teaching college), we
   suggest that an instructor's "teaching self" evolves and is shaped by
   the cultural and institutional environment in which she teaches. We end
   with a call for more systematic research on the effects that
   institutions have on teachers' identities.

AB Many teachers find experiential teaching methods useful for discussing
   emotional and controversial topics such as sexual identity or family
   violence. These methods, many of which include self-disclosure in the
   classroom, can break down the barriers between students and the social
   world. We explore the classroom management of student self-disclosure of
   sensitive topics drawing on our experiences teaching sociology at a
   large, urban university in which a number of students used their
   employment in the sex industry as springboards into class projects.
   Students' concerns with peer disapproval and the processes through which
   they disclosed their involvement in the sex industry raised several
   pedagogical and ethical issues that have not yet been addressed in the
   self-disclosure literature. We examine a number of difficulties with
   students disclosing information partially, either to teachers or to a
   few classmates, on classroom dynamics and teacher-student interactions.
   Finally, we evaluate a number of strategies, such as hidden involvement
   fictitious informant, and full disclosure, for managing self-disclosure
   in the sociology classroom, and we discuss additional steps that
   teachers can take to address sensitive topics in class.

AB One question dominates methodological debate in macrosociology: In
   explaining large-scale social processes should we seek simple theories
   that apply under a range of conditions or complex theories that are
   tailored to specific cases? Complex explanations are justified by their
   explanatory power and theoretical appeal. Simple explanations are
   justified by their falsifiability and their capacity to sustain strong
   conclusions. I weigh the merits of simple and complex explanations,
   applying some basic ideas from Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian
   analysis provides support for a compromise position that is rigorously
   grounded in the fundamental rules of probability. These ideas are

AB This article provides a critical reconstruction of Benjamin Nelson's
   work on the sociology of civilizations. His main concepts for
   civilizational analysis are located within the sociological tradition,
   in particular, the work of Durkheim, Mauss and their school and Max
   Weber. The article focuses especially on the historical, comparative and
   analytic value of Nelson's distinction among three types of structures
   of consciousness (sacro-magical, faith and rationalized structures),
   particularly the historical role of rationalized structures. It suggests
   how these concepts might be given both a fuller analytical
   differentiation and more detailed historical specification. The article
   emphasizes how intercivilizational encounters provide the settings for
   cultural innovations which serve as starting points for the later
   historical transformations of civilizations. Outcomes of civilizational
   encounters between Greece, Rome and Judaism in the Hellenistic era are
   given special attention. The article's main themes are illustrated
   throughout by reference to a variety of substantive issues and
   historical comparative civilizational contexts. These include the role
   of world religions, sciences, philosophies and other cultural forms in
   the ancient world, Western Europe, Russia and elsewhere.

AB To assess the determinants of political support for redistribution, this
   time-series study analyzes historically contingent changes in the
   progressivity of the income tax. Nonviolent civil rights protest should
   increase sympathy for the least affluent and enhance support for
   redistributive policies, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   may have the opposite effect. After controlling for shifts in partisan
   control of the presidency, nonwhite presence, family incomes, and union
   strength, the results suggest that civil rights activity leads to
   redistributive tax codes, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   such as riots or crime reduce tax progressivity. Additional findings
   suggest that these relationships are contingent. The positive
   relationship between civil rights actions and redistributive tax
   policies is significantly stronger when Democrats control the
   presidency, but the negative relationship between riots and egalitarian
   taxation is enhanced during Republican administrations.

AB Child-rearing books and manuals from the early twentieth century
   indicate that pediatricians and developmental psychologists were prone
   to divide the life course of children into increasingly precise
   chronometrical "stages," e.g., focusing on changes from one month to the
   next rather than one year to another. Little is known, however, of
   whether parents also chronometricalized their children's lives. Working
   with 206 advice-seeking letters written by fathers and mothers in the
   1920s and 1930s to nationally known educator and author Angelo Patri
   (1876-1965), we develop a text-based measure of "chronometrical
   childhood," employ it in a multivariate analysis, and find that an urban
   environment heightened parents' tendencies toward chronometricity, while
   the financial strain of the Great Depression did just the opposite. Our
   results show how age can be viewed as a social construction, subject to
   the influence of ideology and economics, and that the scheduling of
   children's lives can vary in different locates and at different
   historical moments.

AB Understanding the complex relationship between immigration and crime was

   wave of immigration to the United States has done little to rekindle
   scholarly interest in this topic, even as politicians and other public
   figures advocate public policies to restrict immigration as a means of
   preventing crime. Although both popular accounts and sociological theory
   predict that immigration should increase crime in areas where immigrants
   settle, this study of Miami, El Paso, and San Diego neighborhoods shows
   that, controlling for other influences. immigration generally does not
   increase levels of homicide among Latinos and African Americans. Our
   results not only challenge stereotypes of the "criminal immigrant" but
   also the core criminological notion that immigration, as a social
   process. disorganizes communities and increases crime.

   study focuses on the impact of life chances and social choices on
   aspects of quality of life in this severely challenged population.
   Regression results show that a number of life chance and social choice
   variables affect general and domain-specific well-being. While chances
   and choices both contribute to these aspects of quality of life, there
   is only modest evidence of a mediating effect. With the exception of
   depressive symptoms, life chances appear to play a more important role
   in quality of life differences than life choices. The specific life
   chance and choice factors influencing aspects of quality of life vary
   with each separate well-being outcome. The implications of these

AB Medical sociology and public health share many of the same concerns in
   the study of social and cultural factors that affect the health of the
   population. Differences in theoretical approaches, methodological
   procedures, conceptualization and measurement, and research objectives,
   however, often serve to limit the potential for collaboration between
   the two disciplines. Sociologists possess many of the theoretical models
   and analytical techniques needed in public health for the study of the
   impact of socioeconomic status, poverty, inequality, differentials in
   power, and social and cultural differences on disease outcomes and
   health status. Although in the past, public health professionals were
   dependent primarily on the theoretical and analytical models offered by
   epidemiology and social psychology, current trends in public health
   research ha ve opened a wider variety of opportunities for sociologists
   to contribute to public health research. Public health has reached a
   crossroads that leads in two directions: a broad approach that addresses
   the sociocultural foundations of health and a more narrow approach
   focusing on more proximal risk factors such as individual lifestyles or
   health risk behaviors. This article presents a review of the factors
   that led to this crossroads in public health and offers suggestions as
   to how sociologists might take advantage of the opportunities afforded
   by the broader approach to public health that is gaining momentum among
   some public health practitioners. Medical sociologists are uniquely
   equipped to assist public health in recapturing its historical
   commitment to social justice in the maintenance of health for the entire
   population.

AB Managed care is prompting a large revision not only in the ways doctors
   are employed and paid but also in the essence of the relationship
   between doctors and patients. In medical sociology, a discipline with a
   long-standing focus on scrutinizing the role of both the physician and
   the patient, there has already been discussion of a shift from the
   doctor as more all knowing to a less dominant position vis-a-vis both
   the patient and delivery of care. Patients are aware of shifts that
   place physicians in an environment characterized by new roles and
   responsibilities, such as acting as a gatekeeper. Limitations on health
   care coverage and the rethinking of roles have led to a depiction of the
   patient as the consumer of care and the managed care plan's becoming the
   commercial enterprise from which a service is obtained. The model of the
   patient as consumer of medically related goods and services appears to
   be growing, as does a model of the physician as one who contracts for a
   specified range of services for specific patients. In this article,
   trends in and problems with contemporary managed care are raised. Calls
   for patients' rights legislation may be among the health trends of the
   new millennium.

   This study discusses the background and usage estimates of Internet
   technology and how this technology affects individuals gathering of
   health information. Potential consequences of this technology for
   patient-provider interactions are also examined, as are the implications
   of Internet communication for social support and health. Current
   measures of social support may be underestimating the effects of social
   support on health by not assessing the influence of support garnered
   through communications on the Internet. The Internet also presents a
   variety of new research venues that medical sociologists should pursue.
   Two of these possibilities-on line surveys and analysis of online
   communication and text-are discussed. Although the Internet is
   increasing research opportunities for medical sociologists, the fact
   that a digital divide still exists with regard to Internet access and

AB Studies have consistently shown race and ethnicity to be important
   determinants of health. The specific nature of this influence, however,
   is still a mystery. In the new millennium, racial and ethnic
   differentials in health are bound to become a major focus in medical
   sociology not only because of their persistence but also because of the
   demographic changes taking place in the United States. It is estimated
   that racial and ethnic minorities are expected to increase from the
   current level of 25 % of all Americans to 40 % by 2030 and that minority
   groups will make up more than hall of the U.S. population by 2050. Thus,
   overcoming health disparities attributable to race and ethnicity has
   become more urgent in ensuring good health for the nation. This article
   suggests that analyses of the health status of Latinos, the second
   largest minority group in the country, must attend to cultural factors.
   The need for a culture-specific approach to Latino health is
   indispensable to such discourses in medical sociology.

AB A theory of collective violence must explain both why it is collective
   and why it is violent. Whereas my earlier work addresses the question of
   why collective violence is violent, here I apply and extend Donald
   Black's theory of partisanship to the question of why violence
   collectivizes. I propose in general that the collectivization of
   violence is a direct function of strong partisanship. Strong
   partisanship arises when third parries (1) support one side against the
   other and (2) are solidary among themselves. Such support occurs when
   third parties are socially close to one side and remote from the ther
   and when one side has more social status than the other Third parries
   are solidary M-hen they are intimate, culturally homogeneous. and
   interdependent. I focus in particular on lynching: Lynching is a joint
   function of strong partisanship toward the alleged victim and weak
   partisanship toward the alleged offender. Unequal strong partisanship
   appears in both classic lynchings (of outsiders) and communal lynchings
   (of insiders) across societies and history. Where partisanship is weak
   or strong on both sides, lynching is unlikely to occur. Evidence
   includes patterns of lynching in various tribal societies. the American
   South, imperial China, and medieval Europe.

   outline the theoretical implications of these regional effects. None of

   West" can adequately incorporate them, so I present an alternative
   theory, based on rational choice premises. Yet the existence of these
   regional effects also highlights the deficiencies of a rational choice
   theoretical approach. First, the approach is unable to explain
   historical contexts, institutional legacies, or the effects of timing,
   which were vital for outcomes of social change but that lie outside the
   model itself. Second, although it can be very useful, the model of the
   actor motivated by material self-interest often proved inadequate in
   historical situations. Solutions are suggested.

AB Professional socialization for sociologists continues to be contested,
   with contemporary debates about 1) the structure of graduate training
   and its rigor, and 2) the content of the body of knowledge that new
   professionals should master. This paper describes the institutional
   practices related to qualifying examinations in 178 U.S. sociology
   graduate departments (response rate 82%). it addresses two broad
   questions: First, what is the structure of qualifying exams in sociology
   Specifically, what is the format, timing, and method of evaluation of
   this requirement How often is this exam system revised Are prestige
   rankings associated with the structure of qualifying exams Second, whet
   is the substance of these exams Do practices across departments reveal a
   "canon" within the discipline of sociology The findings indicate
   significant differences between Ph.D.-granting and M.A.-granting
   programs in exam structures, though there is considerable consistency in
   exam structures within each type of department. in most Ph.D. and M.A.
   programs, there have been recent changes in the format, content or
   evaluation of exams. Ph.D. departments with higher rankings offer
   students more freedom in taking exams and report higher rates of
   successful completion. The substance of exams is quite diverse, both in
   terms of topic areas and readings within those areas, indicating little
   in the way of a sociological "canon" passed down to future professionals
   in the discipline.

AB Laughter emerges naturally in interaction. In the context of the
   telephone survey interview, however, laughter threatens standardization.
   Consequently, some survey research centers prohibit interviewers from
   laughing during the administration of surveys. The data for this study
   are recorded telephone interviews from one such survey research center.
   How interviewers handle the "laughter invitations" of respondents is
   analyzed Because these interviewers are not taught what to do when
   laughter occurs, they rely on their tacit knowledge, either accepting
   the invitation, declining it, or engaging in "pseudo-laughter":
   Interviewers most often decline or use a pseudo-laughing response.
   Laughter patterns in a survey research center that does nor prohibit
   interviewer laughter are examined for comparison, and generally much
   more reciprocation and laughter are observed. Respondent laughter
   exhibits a central tension in the telephone survey interview: How can
   interviewers maintain both standardization and an appropriately
   affiliative social relationship with respondents? The differential
   management of this tension is explored in terms of survey methodology,
   the sociology of (social) scientific knowledge, and the organization of
   talk in institutional settings.

AB This article traces the arrival and the subsequent debates about the
   place of the tourist in sociology. The sociology of tourists first
   focused on their economic, and then their physical and sociocultural
   impacts, in the stereotypical case of mass tourists of the metropolis
   visiting historical and peripheral locations. More recently, Graburn and
   Smith differentiated tourists by class, gender and lifestyle, and then
   by national origin. Tourism has come to be seen as a form of expressive
   and perhaps therapeutic culture comparable to art, play and leisure. The
   tourist as sight-seer was first castigated by snobbish social
   commentators, and then valorized as a seeker of authenticity by
   MacCannell, and as a easter of gazes by Urry. Cohen usefully examined
   the range of tourists' experiences and authenticities. In this special
   issue Lengkeek and Harrison re-examine tourist differentiations,
   authenticities and subjective experiences. Thorns and Perkins conjoin
   the notion of the tourist as sight-seer with that of physical performer,
   while Liebman Parrinello looks at the tourist as both embodied and as
   technologized.

AB The concept of sacrifice used to be a dominant theme in social
   scientific theorizing, but it is now so neglected that recent work
   speaks of the need for a "recovery" of sacrifice. Similarly,
   self-sacrifice in the service of family members, formerly seen as high
   virtue, is now often characterized as personality defect or
   self-defeating behavior. Neither self-sacrifice nor family love play a
   significant part in the prevailing family theories, grounded as they are
   in the assumption of self-interest and framed in the logic of
   utilitarian individualism and the rationalized marketplace. This
   "silence" is more ideologically based than reflective of family process.
   The absence of a language of sacrifice and love limits our ability to
   give voice to our experience, and the professional neglect of these
   concepts diminishes our understanding of the processes they name. Some
   recent work on sacrifice by scholars in other disciplines has
   implications for family theory. We draw from the disciplines of
   economics, history, philosophy, literature, sociology, and from life as
   lived by everyday people ill making the case that self-sacrifice is a
   powerful and essential part of social lift, generally, and family life
   in particular. It merits a more substantial place in contemporary
   theory. Some theoretical approaches compatible with self-sacrifice as
   principle and practice are offered..

AB Trends and patterns of religious mobility have played a central role in
   theoretical controversies in the sociology of religion. Early
   examinations focused on how social status might motivate religious
   switching, and recently scholars have claimed that diminishing status
   differences between denominations have opened denominational boundaries
   and led to higher rates of religious mobility. Scholars working from
   rational actor perspectives have generated several hypotheses. First,
   human capital and adaptive preference theories suggest that switching
   will remain infrequent, and will tend to occur between similar
   denominations. Second, "strict church" perspectives argue that demanding
   sectarian denominations will have higher retention, and be more
   attractive destinations. Third, market niche perspectives argue that
   niche overlap will foster high rates of religious mobility. Finally,
   theories emphasizing normative constraints on religious choices suggest
   that quasi-ethnic religious groups will have a greater hold on members.
   This article examines trends and patterns of religious mobility in the
   U.S. between 1973 and 1998 using data from the General Social Surveys.
   Retention rates, distributions of original and destination affiliations,
   and mobility tables are compared across three periods, and four broad
   cohorts using log-multiplicative association models. I find some support
   for hypotheses generated by status theories, and for several
   propositions from rational actor theories, however the decline of
   denominationalism perspective is unsupported.

   consecutive years Republicans held the presidency, while latent
   political conflict is assessed with economic inequality. The necessity
   to compete for votes with punitive measures is assessed with a
   presidential election dummy. With crime rates and additional effects
   held constant, the presence of a law-and-order Republican president and
   the election variable lead to subsequent expansions in the incarcerated
   population. The length of time Republicans herd the presidency and
   economic inequality also explain this outcome. The results suggest that
   political determinants explain shifts in the percentage of the

AB Our objective is to explore the adequacy of traditional structural
   explanations for the often-documented association between size of place
   and urbanity traits and to raise the possibility that cultural factors,
   too often neglected in urban sociology, play an important role in this
   relationship. Using survey data from a sample ages 15-89, we compare
   four sets of respondents with different child/adult residential
   configurations: those who grew up in nonurban places and as adults live
   in nonurban places (locals), those who grew up in nonurban places but as
   adults reside in urban places (cosmopolitans), those who grew up in
   urban places and reside in urban places as adults (urbanites), and those
   reared in urban places but residing as adults in nonurban places
   (escapees). The sets are compared with respect to six different measures
   of urbanity-anonymity, tolerance, alienation, community social bonds,
   deviant behavior, and involvement in unconventional subcultures. Our
   results support the contention that size has an independent effect on
   urbanity, but Various structural theories generally fail to explain many
   aspects of the relationship. Instead, the views of Hummon (1990) about a
   shared culture of place are most consistent with our findings. We
   conclude by noting the kinds of contributions such a culturalist
   perspective can make to understanding the link between size of place and
   individual characteristics. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

   Sweden, August 27-30, 1994; PS: Political Science and Politics,
   December: 664-683). At the same time, another stream of research
   suggests that racial tolerance is increasing through time (Quillian,
   American Journal of Sociology 101 (3):816-860,1996; Firebaugh and Davis,
   American Journal of Sociology 94 (2):-251-272. This paper combines ideas
   from several intellectual traditions to suggest that economic conditions
   may affect civil society, which in turn may influence social tolerance.
   These ideas are explored, using multivariate analysis of pooled General
   Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994. The results suggest that the
   fabric of civil society and economic conditions may contribute somewhat
   to espoused tolerance. Greater economic security, together with the
   attitudes fostered by a vibrant civil society including greater trust
   and less anomia, appear to increase espoused social tolerance. Period
   effects and the effects of other demographic factors remain strongly
   related to expressions of tolerance. While alternative interpretations
   may be offered depending on whether the interaction terms, Year x
   Education or Cohort x Education, are included in the analysis, the high
   correlation between the two suggests that these interpretations cannot
   be seen as oppositional. Finally and most important, the analysis
   reveals many parallels between espoused racial and homosexual tolerance,
   suggesting a more generalizable model of social tolerance.

AB Fringe religions, often referred to as new religious movements (NRMs),
   or "cults," are a fascinating and theoretically insightful form of
   deviant behavior. For the most part, however, those who have studied
   deviant religions have identified themselves as sociologists of religion
   rather then deviance theorists, and their books and articles dealing
   with deviant religion have primarily been directed toward sociologists
   of religion. As a result, sociologists tend to reach religion as
   deviance in sociology of religion courses but not in deviance or social
   problems courses. The purpose of this paper is to highlight significant
   literature and important theoretical connections relevant to the
   teaching of deviant religions in deviance and social problems courses.
   Deviance conceptions and theory can be easily applied to the study of
   cults, and the result can be academically and intellectually stimulating
   to professor and student alike.

   Employing data from a 1995-1996 nationwide survey of land-grant

   investigate the relative importance of 19 sources of influence on
   agricultural scientists engaged in six research areas:

   combinations of factors. The second major objective is to extend Busch

AB White-on-black violence was a fact of life in the Deep South during the
   decades straddling the turn of the century. Yet though the lynching of
   blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a
   relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex
   and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to
   reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate
   causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the
   analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into
   patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole.
   This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure
   of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930.
   Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of
   local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching
   histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel
   mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the
   analysis of discrete incidents.

AB Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interest in
   religion's special meaning-making function. At the same time, scholars
   have become increasingly sensitive to the fact that the meanings evoked
   by religious symbols, stories, and practices are not universally shared
   and that they vary by social context. To date, sociologists of religion
   interested in the problem of shared meaning have not employed methods
   that can bring together diverse religious meanings and social settings
   in the same research design. As a result, their work has produced few
   empirical generalizations upon which a long-term research agenda might
   be built. In other subdisciplines, such as cultural sociology,
   researchers have employed new quantitative methods that can empirically
   connect variations in cultural meanings to variations in social context.
   This article calls for importing these methodological advances into the
   sociological study of religious meaning.

   while largely agreeing with the explanations, question whether we should
   accept the authors' conclusions. In particular, we need to ask whether
   England was so different from other countries in this respect. Moreover,
   even if sociology was weak in England, does this mean that the
   contribution of English social theory was also weak? What alternative
   traditions of social thought might exist? In examining the English case,
   we may get some insight not just into the "peculiarities of the English"
   but also into the way in which the history of sociology has come to be
   written and into some of the assumptions underlying the nature of

   theories to the history of philosophy. While Collins's marcrosociology
   of knowledge provides important insights into the role of conflict in an
   intellectual field, his microsociology is more problematic. In
   particular. Collins's micro theory ignores the fundamental importance of
   social interpretations. This leads him to use a vague and unproductive
   notion of emotions. Nevertheless, we can usefully apply Collins's
   findings to sociological theory itself As in philosophy we see the same
   competitive appropriation and elaboration of accumulated intellectual
   capital and the same struggle over the limited resources necessary to
   intellectual production, especially over what Collins calls the

AB For more than a decade, sociologists of religion have been debating the
   answer to a basic question: What is the relationship between religious
   pluralism and religious vitality? The old wisdom was that the
   relationship was negative, that pluralism undermines vitality. This view
   has been challenged by advocates of a supply-side model of religious
   vitality. They argue that the relationship is positive-that pluralism
   increases vitality-and this empirical claim has become foundational to
   the larger project of applying economic theory to religion. We review
   the relevant evidence and reach a straightforward conclusion: The
   empirical evidence does not support the claim that religious pluralism
   is positively associated with religious participation in any general
   sense. We discuss this conclusion's theoretical implications, and we
   identify potentially productive directions for future research on
   religious pluralism, church-state relations, and religious competition.

AB The distinctive contribution of sociological social psychology cars be
   referred to as sociological miniaturism, a way of interpreting social
   processes and institutions that is microsociological more than it is
   psychological. We argue that social psychology of this variety permits
   the examination of large-scale social issues by means of investigation
   of small-scale social situations. The power of this approach to social
   life is that it permits recognition of the dense texture of everyday
   life, permits sociologists to understand more fully a substantive
   domain, and permits interpretive control. In the chapter we provide
   examples of this approach from two quite distinct theoretical
   orientations: symbolic interactionism and social exchange theory. We
   discuss the ways in which the study of two substantive topics, social
   power and collective identity, using these perspectives can be informed
   by closer collaboration between theorists within sociological social
   psychology. In the end it is our hope that pursuing such integrative
   theoretical and methodological efforts will produce a more complete
   understanding of important social phenomena. We offer sociological
   miniaturism as a promising vehicle for advancing the earlier call for
   greater mutual appreciation of and rapprochement between diverse lines
   of social psychological work in sociology.

   heterogeneous faculty), increased internal and external pressures for
   accountability, and the idea of students as consumers. These trends call

   question whether or not the norms, standards, and behavioral
   expectations of higher education are shared by today's students. This
   situation presents Sociology departments with significant ethical
   challenges. These include issues related to the development of ethical
   standards and their communication, as well as the establishment of
   policies regarding ethical behavior and their enforcement, for faculty
   members and staff as well as students.

AB There are at least two preferred outcomes for students taking sociology
   courses dealing with race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. These
   include heightening student awareness of the issues and the dynamics of
   inequality. Bath outcomes initiate active engagement with the structures
   and institutions of society. Aii too often, however, apathy, cynicism,
   and helplessness characterize student responses to such courses. A
   solution to this problem is to structure an interdisciplinary course
   using not only a sociological paradigm, but also paradigms of English
   and art. This yearlong course develops the individual student's ability
   to recognize and generate a deep appreciation of multiple perspectives
   (including their own), and helps them acquire critical assessment
   skills. I recommend here an array of resources for teaching about
   resistance and change while establishing an understanding of the
   existence and causes of inequality in American society. Included in this
   battery of resources are readings, mainstream and alternative video
   media, Internet exchanges, student-produced videos, issue-oriented
   student writing, and class discussions.

AB Networks of citations among the papers on a research topic reflect the

   research areas from several disciplines show substantial variation in
   the structure of scholarship, ranging from the frequent and
   disproportionate citation of recent work to the frequent and
   disproportionate citation of foundational documents. The variation is
   inconsistent with the pattern expected of a simple physical
   sciences-behavioral sciences-humanities dimension. Citation-context
   analyses of references in the networks of various fields suggest that
   variation in network structure is due in part to differences in why
   authors cite their colleagues' work: Disproportionate citation of
   foundational documents occurs when authors cite papers as examples of
   perspectives or general approaches rather than as support for specific
   points. Differences in use patterns for citations can help us understand
   other differences among scholarly communities.

AB This article focuses on employers' responses to AFL organizing efforts

   labor markets that incorporates the insights of the neo-Marxist
   divide-and-rule perspective. Second, I use event-structure analysis
   (ESA) to systematically examine causal sequences in the Chicago and Gary
   union campaigns. The analyses suggest that (I) both capitalist and state
   actors meditate conflicts between racial groups in the labor market and
   that (2) employers actively contribute to racial antagonism when
   emergent interracial coalitions threaten to increase labor costs and
   polarize class struggle. The revised split labor market theory explains
   how the features of industrial labor markets affect the strategies of
   employers as well as majority and minority workers.

AB Consistency is a concept central to most social science research. In
   this paper we challenge the typical simplistic assumptions of
   consistency between words and deeds. We contend that consistency is a
   complex concept which must be studied through a situated approach. By
   employing the literature on motives in sociology and communication, we
   consider the means by which actors construct consistency and
   inconsistency in social interaction. Central to this process are
   anticipated or actual, calls for accountability. Consistency and
   inconsistency become issues when we attempt to hold self, or other,
   accountable.

AB Unlike older sciences such as physics and biology, sociology has never
   had a revolution. Modern sociology is still classical-largely
   psychological, teleological, and individualistic-and evert less
   scientific than classical sociology. But pure sociology is different: It
   predicts and explains the behavior of social life with its location and
   direction in social space-its geometry. Here I illustrate pure sociology
   with formulations about the behavior of ideas, ideas, including a theory
   of scienticity that predicts and explains the degree to which an idea is
   likely to be scientific (testable, general, simple, valid, and
   original). For example: Scienticity is a curvilinear function of social
   distance from the subject. This formulation explains numerous facts
   about the history and practice of science, such as why some sciences
   evolved earlier and faster than others and why so much sociology is so
   unscientific. Because scientific theory is the most scientific science,
   the theory of scienticity also implies a theory of theory and a
   methodology far the development of theory.

   actually attained by male graduate student instructors, while they
   misattribute in a downward direction the level of formal education
   attained by women, even when the female faculty member is a full
   professor. The misattributions are linked to the imputed statuses
   "teacher" for women, and "professor" for men, regardless of the actual
   positions held or the credentials earned by faculty members and graduate
   student instructors. We suggest that a process of marginalization
   explains the empirical findings-a process that is attributed by others,

   information via ghettoization and topic context appears to counteract
   the impact of the inclusive content of that information. implications of

   the central focus of recent discussions about pedagogical approaches to

   explore two issues.. first, the need for collective as well as
   individual strategies to deal with the problems generated by race
   relations courses; and second, the unique experiences of graduate
   students of color teaching this class at predominantly white
   universities. This paper offers a model for a collective strategy that
   departments can use to more effectively deal with problems associated
   with such courses. This model is provided by a year-long workshop
   organized by our department to analyze and address challenges posed by
   race relations classes. Our workshop was racially and ethnically
   diverse, allowing us a unique opportunity to deliberately explore the
   experiences of teachers of color. Drawing from this diversity, we
   develop a multidimensional analysis of the institutional and pedagogical
   constraints that create problems for race relations instructors, and we
   sketch a multidimensional approach to minimizing these problems.

   put ideas about pedagogy into practice. Each participant developed an
   undergraduate course from scratch, including a syllabus, assignments,
   lesson plans, assessments and a statement of teaching philosophy.
   Moreover, the seminar itself modeled many of the teaching techniques the
   participants might use in their own courses, including extensive peer
   review. Finally, by practicing the work habits of constancy and
   moderation from Advice for New Faculty Members: Nihil Nimus (Boice
   2000), the participants began to get more done in less time with less
   strain. The positive outcomes of this seminar suggest that this approach

   method encourages students to think of sociology as something that can

AB Friendships with competitors can improve the performance of
   organizations through the mechanisms of enhanced collaboration,
   mitigated competition, and better information exchange. Moreover, these
   benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a
   cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among
   competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information
   culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by
   customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The
   first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the
   friendship-network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with
   performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a
   given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to
   dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved
   if a manager's competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the
   benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis
   examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows
   that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors.

AB This analysis employs the case of lysine price fixing involving the
   food-processing transnational corporation (TNC) Archer Daniels Midland
   (ADM) and Asian-based firms. In an "economy and society" conceptual
   framework grounded in the sociology of agriculture and food, we
   investigate the powers and limits of TNCs in the global era. We argue
   that TNCs maintain significant powers which allow them to avoid the laws
   and regulations of nation-states. ADM was able to organize an illegal
   global cartel to control the world production and price of the feed
   supplement lysine. In addition, TNCs' actions in the global arena are
   limited by their inability to trust business partners and to organize
   and maintain systems of social control; these roles historically have
   been played by the nation-state. We conclude that despite their
   significant powers, TNCs' contradictory position in the global arena
   provides opportunities that can be used to democratize society.

AB Recent research in urban sociology posits that the proliferation of
   female-headed families in American cities is a result of declining
   economic prospects due to profound changes in the structure of the urban
   economy. Meanwhile, macro-level theory and research in criminology
   suggest that an association exists between family structure and rates of
   lethal violence among juveniles. Given these two streams of sociological
   thought, there is good reason to expect that increases in juvenile
   homicide rates since 1970 may be due, in part, to changes in the
   structure of the economy and the family during the 1970 to 1990 period.
   However, the nexus between deindustrialization, female-headed families,
   and juvenile homicide has received little attention in extant research.
   The objective of the current study is to remedy this gap in the
   literature by bringing together ideas about deindustrialization and
   female headship in an attempt to explain city-lever changes in Black and
   White juvenile homicide rates between 1970 and 1990. In particular, the
   research investigates the hypothesis that a decline in the manufacturing
   base of cities increased rates of female headship and thereby indirectly
   raised homicide rates. Race differences in the hypothesized structural
   relationships also are examined.

AB Drawing on a social capital theoretical framework, I examine race,
   ethnic, and gender wage inequalities. Specifically, I extend past
   research by analyzing differences in the mobilization of different types
   of job contacts, what these types of contacts and their level of
   influence "buy" job seekers in the labor market, and the extent to which
   differences in social resources explain between-group variations in
   wages. Four aspects of job contacts are implicated: the race and gender
   of the job contact, the strength of the relationship between the job
   seeker and the job contact, and the job contact's influence. Employing
   the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, I find that white men are more
   likely to mobilize weak, white, male, and influential contacts, those
   contacts hypothesized to positively impact employment outcomes.
   Moreover, their greater mobilization of male and influential ties helps
   to explain a substantial part of their wage advantage over white women
   and Latinos. However, in many ways, their overall social resource
   advantage seems somewhat overstated. They reap no advantages over
   blacks, Latinos, and white women in their use of weak and white ties.
   Furthermore, results indicate that the benefits of social resources
   appear largely contingent on the social structural location of job
   seekers mobilizing them, less on any benefits inherent in different
   "types" of job contacts.

AB This article outlines an emotional achievement perspective for the study
   of emotions in social movements. Following Denzin's work on emotions, I
   consider emotions as self-feelings that are situated, interactional, and
   temporal in nature. The concept of emotions as achievement complements
   Hochschild's emotion management perspective. While management focuses on
   control, achievement emphasizes articulation and creativity. I argue
   that, although individuals may be compelled to suppress feelings in the
   organizational context, different social contexts and practices make it
   possible for individuals to pursue emotional fulfillment and
   self-realization. In social movements, the process of emotional
   achievement among participants unfolds as a process of mobilization. An
   analysis of the emotional dynamics of the 1989 Chinese student movement
   shows that emotions were inextricably intertwined with identities and
   action and that the emotional dynamics generated in this process
   significantly contributed to movement mobilization. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the theoretical contributions of the
   emotional achievement perspective.

AB There is continued frustration over the failure of established social
   theory to be altered despite dramatic developments in women's lives and
   feminist theory. I argue that this process has been blocked by an overly
   static conception of society and gender itself. Close examination of the
   actual circumstances of African American and white women in the
   nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States reveals the relationship
   between gender and economic and political development has been a dynamic
   historical one, culminating recently in a radical transformation of
   women's lives and work. I develop the implications of this argument for
   older analytic divisions between work and home, or productive and
   reproductive labor, and for recent shifts in theory. Coherent grasp of
   the events currently altering women's lives provides a clear way to join
   gender with earlier theoretical concerns, as another moment of social
   transformation brought about by a still-infolding process of economic
   and political development.

AB This paper introduces Niklas Luhmann's final,work, Die Gesellschaft der
   Gesellschaft (The Society of Society). According to Luhmann,
   sociologists have failed to produce even a partially adequate theory of
   society. Epistemological obstacles and humanist concerns for rationality
   and justice have prevented true progress in the discipline. With his
   "radically antihumanist, radically antiregional, and radically
   constructivistic " social system theory Luhmann intends to bring about a
   sociological enlightenment. Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft focuses on
   communication as the only genuinely social phenomenon. Social systems
   differentiate and evolve as they communicate in three separate
   dimensions: the social, temporal, and functional. The path of evolution
   results from a history of variation, selection, and restabilization
   within these discussions. Communication, bit by bit, produces social
   structures that, recursively, produce future structures. Society is
   communication. Sociology, as the science of society: is communication
   about how different societal systems operate, communicate, evolve, and
   maintain their boundaries.

AB Although violence against women is an important topic for many sociology
   classes, teaching about it can be problematic. Students may see violence
   against women as an individual rather than social problem, may
   trivialize or blame victims, or may react defensively. In this paper, I
   present an approach to teaching about violence that addresses some of
   these difficulties. Students keep a one-day journal of their experiences
   of fear and use of safety strategies, and then analyze their findings
   both individually and in discussion with their classmates. This analysis
   helps students to see violence not simply as an individual experience,
   but as a form of social control that differently affects social groups.
   In this paper, I describe this exercise, illustrate its effectiveness
   using excerpts from students journals, and discuss the advantages and
   disadvantages of this pedagogical approach.

   We offered an integrated service-learning option in a variety of

   characteristics to explore differences between participants and
   nonparticipants. We surveyed undergraduates (N = 413) from across the
   academic spectrum and enrolled in sociology courses at a large state
   university. The results contradict previous findings: we found
   heterogeneous participation in the service-learning project; no
   statistical association between prior and current service; commuter
   status and employment appear to influence student decisions to opt; and
   non-social science majors are more likely to participate than social
   science majors. Confirming previous studies, males are less likely to
   participate than females. Research in sociology shows strong support for
   service learning in passing on sociology. Results suggest students'
   other life demands should be taken into account when implementing a

   who rate their instructor high in likability reward that instructor with
   high ratings in overall reaching ability. However, high likability
   ratings are also associated with a decrease in student perceptions of
   learning. The negative effect of likability on perceived learning
   juxtaposed with its positive impact on global teacher ratings gives some
   credence to sociological critiques of student consumerism in higher
   education. Namely, when students approach college as customers, they
   expect to be entertained and served only in ways they find pleasing.
   Suggestions for more appropriate use of student evaluations of teaching

AB Demographic transition theory posits that modernization, particularly in
   the form of urban industrialism, fundamentally alters the environmental
   context surrounding fertility decision-making, thereby reducing the
   advantages of having children. While fertility research has either
   questioned the link between modernization and fertility or attempted to
   provide the intervening links between the two, there has been, little
   theoretical or empirical refinement of the macrosocial/contextual
   principles of the theory. We argue that human ecology and evolutionary
   theory can help respecify and revitalize demographic transition theory.
   Our respecification produces a more logical account of fertility decline
   that emphasizes the influences of service economies and the social
   adaptations attendant on ethnic heterogeneity and preindustrial social
   complexity. Analyses of changes in total fertility rates in
   approximately 60 less-developed countries suggest: (I) general (if
   partially ambiguous) support for demographic transition theory, (2)
   confirmation of a robust effect of service-sector dominance on
   fertility, and (3) the importance of ethnic homogeneity and
   preindustrial social complexity to demographic transition.

   is not a cure for this dilemma, we argue that researchers can be
   self-conscious about the ways in which they reproduce power in the

   will enrich ethnographic accounts. We begin by outlining the diverse
   ways in which feminist ethnographers draw on standpoint epistemology to
   generate strong reflexive methodological strategies. Then we describe
   challenges posed by postmodern and postcolonial critics, and outline how
   feminists have contributed to these debates and have responded with
   innovative methodological strategies, especially in relation to
   self-reflexive techniques. In conclusion, we discuss how rural

   construction of reality. Affirmative action provides a perfect example,
   as sociologists actively define and construct what constitutes
   affirmative action through narrative. I argue that taking narratives
   seriously is key to confronting anti-affirmative action narratives and
   denaturalizing white privilege.

AB This article extends earlier work (Ulmer 1994) in applying Johnson's
   (1991) threefold commitment framework to deviance and social control.
   The central individual-level theories of deviance (differential
   association/social learning, opportunity, social control, and labeling)
   share the generic sociological goal of theorizing continuity in lines of
   action. This suggests the centrality of the concept of commitment, and
   in fact the concept is used throughout the study of deviance and social
   control. The threefold framework provides a superior conceptualization
   of commitment for the field of deviance. In addition, it integrates
   insights from the central deviance theories and directs attention to a
   wide variety of un- and underexplored directions for further research in
   deviance and social control. In addition, I briefly discuss broader
   implications of the commitment framework for other areas of inquiry,
   such as the study of social protest and the sociology of organizations.

AB Mob sociology is a theory of crowd behavior that is found in U.S. police
   literature and that has been used to design and justify demonstration
   management practices. Mob sociology is derived from sociological
   theories about crowd behavior but ignores their originators' assertions
   that crowds occur within a larger social context. Mob sociology was
   diffused throughout the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s
   through a national civil disorder training program and a variety of
   police manuals and magazines. It is highly compatible with the escalated
   force style of protest policing and has lost much of its influence since
   the introduction of negotiated management practices. How ever, it is
   still present in police literature and training programs and should be
   replaced by contemporary social science research and theory.

AB Much debate concerning small-N analysis has centered on the question of
   whether this research tradition has powerful tools for assessing
   causality. Yet, recent contributions make it clear that scholars are not
   in consensus with regard to the more basic: issue of which procedures
   and underlying logic are in fact used in small-N causal assessment.
   Focusing on the field of comparative-historical analysis, this article
   attempts to clarify these procedures and logic. Methods associated with
   three major strategies of small-N causal inference are examined: nominal
   comparison, ordinal comparison, and within-case analysis. The article
   argues that the use of these three strategies within particular small-N
   studies has led scholars to reach radically divergent conclusions about
   the logic of causal analysis in small-N research. One implication of
   this argument is that methodologists must sort our the interrelationship
   between strategies of causal inference before arriving at conclusions
   about the overall strengths and limitations of small-N analysis.

AB This article examines the types of research methods sociologists
   studying women and gender use in articles published in mainstream
   journals. The research is based on an analysis of 1,826 gender-content
   articles published between 1984 and 1993 in 15 major sociology journals.
   Specifically, we explore whether feminist-oriented articles use
   different types of data, data collection methods, and statistical
   techniques than other articles addressing women and gender. The
   relationship between the rank of an academic journal, author's sex, and
   type of research method is also examined. We find that a large majority
   of gender-content articles are based on secondary, quantitative data.
   When the first author is a man, articles are somewhat more likely to be
   based on secondary data and to use quantitative statistical techniques.
   In general, we find that feminist research in the discipline is based on
   a melange of methodological approaches, reflecting the contested nature
   of feminist epistemologies.

AB Affirmative action policy in the United States has recently come under
   intense political attack. Opponents have developed strategies to
   eliminate affirmative action using stare referendums, often engaging in
   misleading public campaigns. in this political atmosphere, the role of
   education is significant. For many of our students, introductory
   sociology may be one of the few courses in which they are exposed to
   serious academic discussions about affirmative action. We examine the
   extent to which sociology texts accurately present affirmative action
   policy in the United States using a sample of introductory texts
   published from 1994 through 1997. We critically examine whether material
   presented either confronts or contributes to widespread myths about
   affirmative action policy. We conclude by offering practical suggestions
   to strengthen affirmative action presentations in sociology texts,
   including drawing upon significant empirical and theoretical
   sociological literature about affirmative action too often ignored by
   textbook authors.

AB Experiential learning is a flexible instructional tool, adaptable to
   suit most courses. However, only a minority of instructors use these
   types of assignments in their courses. I examine whether short-term
   experiential learning reduces the drawbacks that may prevent instructors
   from using this instructional technique. I explore instructor and
   student perspectives on three types of short-term exercises:
   observations, participant-observations, and field trips. I find that
   short-term experiential assignments reduce the logistical concerns
   involved in experiential exercises and increase the opportunities for
   analytical reflection, especially for instructors of smaller courses and
   for non-field trip activities, in large introductory lecture courses,
   additional steps to structure the reflection process can successfully
   alleviate many of the problems dealing with lack of analysis. Proper
   selection of exercises included and careful choices about their use in
   courses or units with sensitive subject matter will help increase the
   chance of positive learning outcomes.

AB in this paper we introduce a wonderful video resource that can enhance
   the undergraduate learning experience. The animated television series,
   The Simpsons, can be particularly effective for illustrating
   sociological themes and encouraging critical thinking among today's
   undergraduates. Borrowing from Mills (1959), The Simpsons complements
   teaching philosophies that stress applying the sociological imagination
   to the observation of everyday life. We have found that the show is an
   effective pedagogical tool for demonstrating sociological concepts and
   fostering students' understanding of the course material Students can
   relate to the show and by engaging them in critical discussions, The
   Simpsons is a valuable pedagogical resource to the sociology curriculum.
   The true indication of successful teaching is measured by the students'
   ability to grasp course material effectively, and then use that
   knowledge beyond the classroom. The Simpsons provides an excellent way
   To accomplish this goal.

AB This article argues that a common organizational practice-the hiring of

   of social capital. Employers who use such hiring methods are
   quintessential "social capitalists," viewing workers' social connections
   as resources in which they can invest in order to gain economic returns
   in the form of better hiring outcomes. Identified are three ways through
   which such returns might be realized: the "richer pool," the "better
   match," and the "social enrichment" mechanisms. Using unique company
   data on the dollar costs of screening, hiring, and training, this
   article finds that the firm's investment in the social capital of its
   employees yields significant economic returns.

AB Standard sociological theories of 'taste-as-refinement', which view
   taste as a means to maintain social distance among different social
   classes, conflict with tastemaking practice in pluralistic societies
   where taste standards are no longer exclusively defined by a society's
   elite strata. To better account for the heterogeneity of tastemaking in
   modem societies, this article suggests a framework for analysis in which
   taste is considered as a collective interpretive activity that unfolds
   in distinct institutional contexts and is shaped by culturally available
   rhetorics of aesthetic judgment. Two conflicting but complementary
   rhetorics are identified: the rhetoric of refinement and the rhetoric of
   authenticity. Drawing on historical studies of taste, the role of
   institutional context for tastemaking is demonstrated. Taste in
   pluralistic society emerges in socially, politically and rhetorically
   contested institutional spaces where it is negotiated among a plurality
   of actors who have recourse to alternative rhetorics and
   classifications.

AB Race has always been a significant sociological theme, from the founding
   of the held and the formulation of classical theoretical statements to
   the present. Since the nineteenth century, sociological perspectives on
   race have developed and changed, always reflecting shifts in large-scale
   political processes. In the classical period, colonialism and
   biologistic racism held sway. As the twentieth century dawned, sociology
   came to be dominated by US-based figures. DuBois and the Chicago School
   presented the first notable challenges to the field's racist
   assumptions. In the aftermath of World War II, with the destruction of
   European colonialism, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the
   surge in migration on a world scale, the sociology of race became a
   central topic. The field moved toward a more critical, more egalitarian
   awareness of race, focused particularly on the overcoming of prejudice
   and discrimination. Although the recognition of these problems increased
   and political reforms made some headway in combatting them, racial
   injustice and inequality were not surmounted. As the global and domestic
   politics of race entered a new period of crisis and uncertainty, so too
   has the field of sociology. To tackle the themes of race and racism once
   again in the new millennium, sociology must develop more effective
   racial theory. Racial formation approaches can offer a starting point
   here. The key tasks will be the formulation of a more adequate
   comparative historical sociology of race, the development of a deeper
   understanding of the micro-macro linkages that shape racial issues, and
   the recognition of the pervasiveness of racial politics in contemporary
   society. This is a challenging but also exciting agenda. The held must
   not shrink from addressing it.

AB The variant of new institutionalism that is our focus is a
   pan-disciplinary theory that asserts that actors pursue their interests
   by making choices within institutional constraints. We organize our
   review of the theory around its behavioral assumptions, the operation of
   institutional forms, and processes of institutional change. At each
   stage, we give particular attention to the potential contributions of
   sociology to the theory. The behavioral assumptions of the theory amount
   to bounded rationality and imply transaction costs, which, in the
   absence of institutions, may frustrate collective ends. The principle
   weakness of these behavioral assumptions is a failure to treat
   preferences as endogenous. We categorize the institutions that arise in
   response to transaction costs as to whether they are public or private
   in their source and centralized or decentralized in their making. In
   detailing the resulting categories of institutional forms, we identify
   key interdependencies across the public/private and
   centralized/decentralized dimensions. The new institutionalism is in
   particular need of better theory about private decentralized
   institutions, and theorists could turn to embeddedness theory and
   cognitive new-institutional theory as a source of help on this topic.
   The dominant view of institutional change is that it is evolutionary,
   driven by organizational competition, and framed by individual beliefs
   and shared understandings. Sociology can refine the change theory by
   adding better explanations of the behavior of organizations, and of the
   processes by which institutional alternatives come to be viewed as
   acceptable or unacceptable.

AB Modernity glorifies hyperconsumerism and hyperindividualism, and gives
   rise to a consciousness of human separation from and superiority to
   nature. To counter these threats to our biological and sociological
   ecosystems, higher education in general, and sociology in particular,
   must adopt postmodern strategies to educate for survival. The
   metanarratives that served the modern age, such as "science" and
   "progress," prove inadequate for the postmodern age of ecological
   crisis. We urgently need a more life-centered vision. The ecological
   perspective replants our feet on the bedrock of biological and
   sociological connectedness. Although science has been central to
   modernity's destructiveness, ecology is a subversive science which can
   serve us well as both science and story; it is the central
   transformative image of a new postmodern metanarrative.

AB Previous research has concluded that representation of diversity is
   often limited in introductory sociology textbooks. One area of diversity
   that has not been studied in these textbooks is the topic of disability,
   in this research, 25 introductory sociology textbooks, published between
   1996 and 1998, are investigated to determine the portrayal of
   disability. Using content analysis, the authors examine these books for
   textual representation of disability and pictorial depiction of
   individuals with disabilities. Results indicate that introductory
   sociology textbooks provide a limited amount of information about
   disability. From the written material, two major themes are identified:
   disability as a defining social characteristic and disability as a basis
   for minority group membership. in addition, textbook photographs present
   a selective depiction of individuals with disabilities. Suggestions for
   providing a more comprehensive portrayal of individuals with
   disabilities are discussed.

AB Sociology students at Santa Clara University are expected to learn to do
   four things in developmental stages: recognize basic concepts to
   cultivate sociological perspective, apply sociological concepts,
   interpretive frameworks, and analytical tools to real world problems
   (fostering greater commitment to life-long learning about one's
   community and the world at large), offer explanations extending one's
   own thinking, sensibly gather data to test those explanations (providing
   the tools for a culture of inquiry and evidence), and envision how
   sociology can be used for organizational effectiveness and improvement
   of community outcomes (empowering our students for lives of constructive
   involvement). A variety of assessment strategies are proving vital.
   Broad stakeholder input was used when clarifying program objectives.
   Deliberations about how to change our program are being stimulated by
   performance problems in internships and on major papers. We have learned
   that developmental goals are not readily achieved without changes
   throughout the program's curriculum, and implementation has been
   incremental, initial changes have increased the confidence of graduating
   seniors, and job placement has improved.

AB I extend the theoretical domain of sociology into an area of social
   psychology that heretofore has been the exclusive domain of
   psychologists. Specifically, I develop a social structural perspective
   on the choice shifts make within groups. During interpersonal
   discussions of issues, choice shifts occur when there is a difference
   between group members' mean final opinion and their mean initial
   opinion. Explanations of choice shifts have emphasized group-level
   conditions (e.g., a norm, a decision rule, a pool of persuasive
   arguments, a distribution of initial opinions). I argue that choice
   shifts are a ubiquitous product of the inequalities of interpersonal
   influence that emerge during discussions of issues. Hence, I bring
   choice shifts squarely into the domain of a structural social psychology
   that attends to the composition of networks of interpersonal influence
   and into broader sociological perspectives concerned with the formation
   of status structures.

   developed in the humanities. In the face of recent challenges to
   sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and
   economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and
   communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the
   constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key
   weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the
   inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three
   significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out
   alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social
   signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the
   basis of a dialogue between cultural studies and sociology.

   attempts to resolve some of the issues raised in these debates by
   developing a distinction between universal and historically conditional
   theory through a contrast between work by such leaders of the revived
   comparative historical tradition as Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, and
   Immanuel Wallerstein and selected works by second-generation comparative
   historical sociologists. The conditional theories of the second
   generation incorporate narrative and conjunctural temporality,
   theory-driven comparison, and historically conditional generalization
   that were not emphasized in the universalizing theories and comparisons
   of the first generation.

   The issues include broad versus narrow scope conditions, explicit versus

   irony of the conflict is that each side makes ample use of the other's
   product despite condemning its progenitor: The authors offer a
   hierarchical approach to qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) as a
   method for linking deductive and inductive approaches, and link SCA to
   game theory as a way to design more dynamic comparative studies The
   authors illustrate this method through a split labor market analysis of

AB Recent work by political sociologists and social movement theorists
   extend our understanding of how religious institutions contribute to
   expanding democracy, but nearly all analyze religious institutions as
   institutions; few focus directly on what religion qua religion might
   contribute. This article strives to illuminate the impact of religious
   culture per se, extending recent work on religion and democratic life by
   a small group of social movement scholars trained also in the sociology
   of religion. In examining religion's democratic impact, an explicitly
   cultural analysis inspired by the new approach to political culture
   developed by historical sociologists and cultural analysts of democracy
   is used to show the power of this approach and to provide a fuller
   theoretical account of how cultural dynamics shape political outcomes.
   The article examines religious institutions as generators of religious
   culture, presents a theoretical model of how religious cultural elements
   are incorporated into social movements and so shape their internal
   political cultures, and discusses how this in turn shapes their impact
   in the public realm. This model is then applied to a key site of
   democratic struggle: four efforts to promote social justice among
   low-income urban residents of the United States, including the most
   widespread such effort-faith-based community organizing.

   concept The article constructs an argument that the concept lacks

   some of our discipline's central concepts and to serve as an exercise in
   the application of the sociological imagination. Films, however, come
   prepackaged with a particular worldview or theoretical perspective.
   Thus, they require the sociologist to consider the theory-laden nature
   of movies as part of the analysis of social life that they depict. in
   order to do this, I analyze three groups of movies through the use of
   sociological concepts such as Griswold's "cultural diamond" and
   Jameson's ideology/utiopa distinction.

   necessary for completing the progressive educational and social reforms
   sought by both, thus enabling us to fulfill Mills' "promise" for our

   outlined in particular, this paper discusses the ways in which key
   concepts in social psychology can be applied using a cross-cultural
   autobiography, and it examines the utility of using such a text. A
   survey evaluation of this approach reveals that students generally
   accept a multicultural approach to social psychology and feel that it
   aids in their understanding of key concepts. in addition, a comparison
   of exam means and performance on selected rest items indicate no
   negative consequences of implementing such an approach. This paper also
   discusses the advantages and disadvantages of such a transformation and
   approach.

AB Religious nationalism represents an institutional project to transform
   the ontology of the social, to redefine the substance of collective
   representation, the principle of domination and the criteria for
   membership. Religious nationalism transforms the territorial
   nation-state into a vehicle in and by which to extend the materiality of
   its culturally specific categories, codes, values and narratives. It
   thereby challenges social theories, like that of Bourdieu, that
   deculturalize power, as well as those, like Alexander, that culturalize
   it in an institutionally restrictive manner. Religious nationalism is
   not a retreat to the premodern, but an effort to bound and energize the
   elemental modem moments, that of the self and the national-state.
   Religious nationalism represents the return to text, to the fixity of
   signs, the renarrativization of the nation in a cosmic context. It
   returns us to bodies and souls, a zone to be defended against things on
   the one side and beasts on the other. It offers a way to secure morality
   against an increasingly post-humanist world. Its discourse of difference
   seeks to bound the nation. Religious nationalism restores the binaries
   of inside and outside, us and them, good and evil, man and woman and
   centers them in sacred space.

AB The economic experiences and economic anxiety of rural and urban
   residents of the Czech and Slovak Republics during the postcommunist
   reforms are compared and related to their support for the reforms. The
   analysis is based on five national surveys, 1992-1996, collected by the
   Sociology Institute of the now Czech Academy of Sciences. Net of
   controls, both Czech and Slovak rural respondents report more economic
   strain and unemployment, a difference that persists over the surveys.
   These experiences account for rural residents' greater economic anxiety,
   their fear of economic development and unemployment, which also persists
   over the surveys. These experiences and anxiety explain, in turn, their
   lower level of support for the reforms, and endorsement of a return to
   socialism and strong-hand government. Rural and urban respondents of the
   two countries have experienced the world differently since 1990, and
   this is expressed in their economic anxiety and political preferences.

AB The core of sociology is the key thing that we share as sociologists -
   the basic-way of viewing social life that makes us distinctive as a
   discipline. This core is the content that we have to communicate to a

   core is a structure in which there are a high density of positive
   network ties within the discipline, relatively weak subdivisions within
   the discipline, and a lower density of ties linking us to outside
   institutions. I use structural and social psychological theory to talk
   about the interactional dynamics that weaken this optimal disciplinary
   structure. The hope is that these theoretical insights will help us deal
   productively with some of the major social changes that are occurring
   within our field. fend with eight theoretically derived propositions to

AB Recent work in the sociology of professions highlights the central
   importance of abstract discourse in professionalization processes.
   Drawing on the work of Kenneth Burke, I argue that broadening the focus
   of analysis from "abstract discourse" to "narratives of expertise" will
   provide the ability to (1) more clearly analyze the social conditions
   that are conducive to the efficacy of abstraction as a basis for a claim
   of expertise and (2) theorize and empirically examine the formation and
   maintenance of a collective professional identity. To assist in the
   reformulation of professionalization studies around narratives of
   expertise, I develop a modified extension of Burke's five key terms of
   dramatism (act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose). Burke's pentadic
   scheme enables researchers to show how narratives of expertise ground
   jurisdictional claims and the constitution of professional identity in
   one of the elements of pentad. I illustrate the empirical power of the
   pentadic scheme through an examination of claims of psychotherapeutic
   expertise, particularly claims of marital and familial expertise.

AB As rational choice theory has moved from economics into political
   science and sociology, it has been dramatically transformed. The
   intellectual diffusion of agency theory illustrates this process. Agency
   theory is a general model of social relations involving the delegation
   of authority, and generally resulting in problems of control, which has
   been applied to a broad range of substantive contexts. This paper
   analyzes applications of agency theory to state policy implementation in
   economics, political science, and sociology. After documenting
   variations in the theory across disciplinary contexts, the strengths and
   weaknesses of these different varieties of agency theory are assessed.
   Sociological versions of agency theory incorporating both broader
   microfoundations and richer models of social structure, are in many
   respects the most promising. This type of agency theory illustrates the
   potential of art emerging sociological version of rational choice
   theory.

   conditions explain subsequent shifts in total spending on jails and
   prisons. Increases in the political strength of the the Republican
   Party, past breakdowns in the family, and growth in the tax base lead to
   greater spending on correct-ions as well, but neither unemployment nor
   economic inequality are associated with these outlays. In comparison to
   findings about the determinants of imprisonment rates, the results of

   with more female graduate students, and departments in urban public,

   few well-cited scholars receive lower scores than departments with

   the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on
   risk, safety and risk as dynamic properties of social systems, and the
   social forces that create and allocate risk. In particular, sociologists
   need to place more emphasis on exploring the roles played by
   organizations and the state in hazard production and on formulating a
   political economy of risk. To a significantly greater degree than other
   disciplines concerned with risk, sociology emphasizes the contextual
   factors that structure vulnerability to hazards and the linkages that

   find a broad range of uses of life histories in the areas of substantive

   relationship of oral/life history to other materials, purpose of the re
   search, and relationship of oral/life history to other phenomena. We
   conclude that life history methods have not had the transformative
   effect on sociology that they have had in other disciplines. By and
   large, the actual production of life histories continues to be
   ahistorical, to be characterized by abstract empiricism, to extinguish
   subjects, and to ignore the link between biography and history.

AB The enduring effects of an individual's birth order have been subject to
   a long and lively debate in sociology and other disciplines. Recently,
   in response to Sulloway's (1996) Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family
   Dynamics, and Creative Lives, interest has increased in the possible
   effects of birth order on social attitudes. Using quantitative,
   historical data, Sulloway found that birth order is a better predictor
   of social attitudes than is gender, class, or race. His novel,
   evolutionary theory asserts the universal influence of birth order
   across eras and cultures. We use contemporary data to test Sulloway's
   contention that firstborn adults are more conservative, supportive of
   authority, and "tough-minded" than laterborns. Examining 24 measures of
   social attitudes from the General Social Survey (GSS), we find no
   support for these claims, either in terms of significant effects or even
   the direction of nonsignificant coefficients. An expanded inquiry using
   all (202) relevant attitudinal items on the GSS yields similar results.
   In our analysis, variables discounted by Sulloway-gender, race, social
   class, and family size-are all linked to social attitudes more strongly
   than is birth order: Our findings suggest that birth-order theories may
   be better conceptualized in terms of modest effects in limited domains
   and in specific societies.

   technologies with consistent themes, including enhancement of cognitive
   strategies (note taking and organization of ideas) and motivation.
   However, students also expressed distancing from the instructor. Surveys
   of the same student groups and a journal kept by the course professor
   reflected similar themes. Student achievement outcomes (pre- and
   posttest scores) showed no differences across two classroom applications
   of multimedia presentations: static and dynamic. Sociology instructors
   should consider adopting more complex computer multimedia in light of
   balancing interests: (1) resource scarcity in education and (2) few
   direct demonstrable effects of media on objective measures of student
   test outcomes in this and other research. However, our participants
   consistently cite considerable enhancement of students' cognitive skills
   and motivations (especially note taking and student interest levels),
   and our instructors endorse the positive effects of multimedia
   development on the process of reworking and rethinking their course
   curricula and materials.

AB Employing literature as a pedagogical tool in the sociology classroom is
   a well-known and accepted practice in many courses and curricula. Yet
   nearly every discussion of this "sociology through literature" approach
   either explicitly refers to or implies the; use of novels. in this
   paper, the sociology through literature approach is extended to include
   poetry as pedagogically useful classroom material Poetry provides many
   of the gains attributed to using literature in general, while also
   conveying some unique advantages over other literary forms. I discuss
   the benefits of using poetry to teach and apply sociological concepts,
   and provide specific examples of how I employ this technique to teach
   social inequality.

AB This article demonstrates that popular music's potential as a tool for
   teaching interactive introductory sociology courses is enhanced when a
   cultural analysis of a specific music genre is incorporated into the
   classroom. Using this type of analysis as an integrative course theme
   promotes active learning as students apply sociological ideas to explain
   empirical reality. Using heavy metal music as an example, I present a
   two-part model for integrating a cultural analysis of this music and its
   subculture into the introductory course. Students first conduct a
   sociologically grounded cultural analysis of heavy metal music. Then
   they expand this analysis during the rest of the course by applying new
   concepts, theories, and research to explain this cultural object
   sociologically The article's final section discusses the application of
   this model in a range of class contexts and provides student responses
   to its use in an introductory sociology course.

AB The notion of the constraint (or degree of organization) of belief
   systems is a potentially fruitful one in both political science and
   sociology. Existing attempts to measure constraint, however, have had
   severe drawbacks, both conceptual and methodological. This paper argues
   that this constraint is better conceived of as the absence of dispersion
   in a table of cross-classified beliefs and demonstrates that measures
   based on this conception are better at discerning the presence of
   constraint where it is quite likely to exist, namely, in small,
   ideologically focused groups. The approach to constraint outlined here
   has a number of other advantages: it is equally appropriate to interval,
   ordinal, or nominal data; it does not require external criteria of what
   responses should be associated with others; it is not
   variance-dependent; it does not assume that constraint is equivalent to
   either reduced dimensionality or pairwise association; and it is equally
   appropriate for mass and nonmass belief systems. It is also simple to
   conduct tests of significance difference across populations. Finally,
   this paper outlines the proper way to standardize such measures, which
   applies to other uses of the entropy measure, such as the quantification
   of income inequality. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB As the scare of the '80s demonstrated, sociology finds itself in the
   dubious position of being vulnerable within the university while being
   vitally dependent upon the university for its existence. In response,
   sociology has accommodated market-driven changes in the university by
   expanding entrepreneurial forms of research and has struggled to
   legitimate itself professionally. These quests, however, have removed
   sociology further from the reaches of the broader public, diminishing
   its long-standing tradition of addressing public issues. Re-establishing
   the vitality of the discipline will require sociology to reclaim its
   public. To do so, changes will have to be made within the profession
   that encourage the role of public intellectuals, while efforts will have
   to be made to expand public spaces where public discourse and social
   action can occur.

AB This article begins with an autobiographical reflection about what
   sociology has meant to me as an Iranian intellectual. Sociology has
   enabled me to think critically about my country's politics and culture,
   appreciating its strengths without overlooking its unjust and injurious
   aspects. That experience shapes my answer to the question "Saving
   Sociology?" If there is anything in sociology that I would like to
   save-in both senses "to keep" and "to rescue"-it is sociology as a
   critical, reflective discipline, a discipline that not only studies
   society but also contributes to its change. As the contemporary world
   moves toward a "global" society, we are increasingly facing the dilemmas
   of multiculturalism. Sociologists often investigate other societies or
   (like myself) look back at their own from a spatial and cultural
   distance. This situation has created a dilemma for many scholars: Should
   we criticize problems stemming from "indigenous" beliefs and practices
   of other societies? Cultural relativism argues that different cultures
   provide indigenous answers to their social problems that should be
   judged in their own context. While this approach correctly encourages us
   to avoid ethnocentrism, it has led to inaction towards the suffering of
   oppressed groups. Reflecting on the relativist approach to sexual
   dominance, I question some cultural relativist assumptions. Discussing
   how "indigenous" responses to male domination in many cases disguise and
   protect that domination, I will challenge the "localist" approach of
   relativism and argue for a universalist approach.

AB What is the value-added character of sociology? In an era of change and
   unease in higher education, can a case be made for sociology in terms of
   intellectual and scholarly substance rather than in terms of
   bureaucratic and political considerations? As a scholarly and
   instructional activity, what is the value of sociology beyond what other
   disciplines have to offer? I address these questions affirmatively in
   this paper by identifying and elaborating four distinctive foci of the
   sociological eye that together frame the window onto the world that
   sociology provides. These distinctive features are a focus on the
   relational connections among the constituent elements of the objects of
   sociological analysis; a focus on the socially contextual embeddedness
   of those objects of analysis; a focus on vexing social conditions and
   processes construed as social problems; and an ironic perspective, that
   is, a penchant for discerning and illuminating the incongruous,
   unexpected, discrepant aspects of social life. I argue that these foci
   are more pronounced in sociology than in other social sciences and that
   together they congeal into a window onto the social world that is unique
   among the social sciences and humanities, thus accounting for the
   value-added character of sociology.

   is, what was "out there" to be reflected in the pages of ARS. I lay out
   some statistics on trends in the size, countries, and universities
   represented, coauthorship patterns, and gender ratios in ARS. These
   statistics are very informative but contain few surprises. Next I trace
   and analyze an issue that has commmanded the attention of editors of ARS
   throughout its history-unity or diversity of sociology as a discipline.
   Finally I conclude that the ARS does indeed reflect the field in ways
   that can be documented, but that this process of reflection is subject
   to many imprecisions generated by the editorial process itself.

   examining the linguistic style of aphorisms, their reconceptions of
   experience from deceptive surfaces to more fundamental truths, their
   psychological and social effects on the vanity and status of their
   creators and conveyers, and the decline of their conceptual charisma
   into cliche until a surprising modification restarts the aphorism-cliche
   cycle. The investigation of aphorisms broadens to their intellectual and
   cultural contexts by examining their expansion into articles and
   collection into books, the different aspects of a topic revealed by
   aphoristic perspectives and scientific sequences, and the similarities
   (and differences) between aphoristic and postmodern ways of knowing.
   This article ends with a series of aphorisms on the cognitive substance
   of alluring knowledge, which distinguish some of the components of

   some serious adjustments to the ways in which many applied sport
   psychologists and spore sociologists think about and conduct research
   are required. Thus, the initial part of this article expresses some
   critiques, albeit brief, of current tendencies within both sport
   sociology and sport psychology. We deemed these critiques necessary to
   advance a neo-Millsian position on the articulation of social structure
   and personality. This neo-Millsian position draws on the
   ego-psychoanalytical tradition to offer suggestions for how we might
   reconceive the problems of indispensability/expendability in the
   Prolympic structures of sport and for how we might, using a
   life-histories (biographical) methodology, engage in useful or practical
   research, especially on the problematics of how individuals
   handle/mishandle early, pre-career, and mid-career failure, and, in the
   long-run, inevitable failure at the end of their careers. Where, then,
   is the common ground between sport sociology and sport psychology? We
   argue that it is the analysis of ego-practices and ego-defenses as
   learned, consciously or unconsciously, over our biographical lives as
   they intersect with, and are contoured by, social history and social
   structure.

   The research analyzes reviewers' comments regarding a recently published

   review affects sociology texts in at least five ways: (1) degree of

   length, (3) reading level, (4) ancillaries and accessories, and (5) the
   marketing strategies that will be used by publishers to "sell" the book.
   The findings suggest that, although the peer review process generally

   possibilities for and understandings of minor resource production
   activities. Maple syrup generally only supplemented the household income
   of the 76 producers interviewed. Producers articulated a cultural
   economy of syrup production centered on its contribution to overall
   livelihood, cultural identity, and lifestyle. Reasons included managing
   risks, making seasonal use of land and labor resources, developing a
   retirement income, demonstrating a rural, agrarian identity, and
   strengthening family and community ties. Implications for policy include
   the place of minor resource production activities in securing rural

AB Globalization has made it increasingly necessary to break with
   nation-state centered analysis in macrosociologies. Social structure is
   becoming transnationalized, and an epistemological shift is required in
   concurrence with this ontological change. A new interdisciplinary
   transnational studies should be predicated on a paradigmatic shift in
   the focus of social inquiry from the nation-stare as the basic unit of
   analysis to the global system as the appropriate unit. Sociology's
   fundamental contribution to a transnational studies should be the study
   of transnational social structure. This article does not establish a new
   transnational paradigm. Rather, it surveys and critiques
   nation-state-centrism in extant paradigms, provides a rationale for a
   new transnational approach, and proposes a research curriculum of a new
   transnational studies that may contribute to paradigmatic
   reconceptualization.

   sociology. It begins with a detailed analysis of causality statements in
   Durkheim's Le suicide. It then discusses the history of causality
   assumptions in sociological writing since the 1930s, with brief remarks
   about the related discipline of econometrics. The author locates the
   origins of causal argument in a generation of brilliant and brash young
   sociologists with a model and a mission and then briefly considers the
   history of causality concepts in modem philosophy. The article closes
   with reflections on the problems created for sociology by the
   presumption that causal accounting is the epitome of explanation within
   the discipline. It is argued that sociology should spend more effort on
   (and should better reward) descriptive work.

AB Typically, using data from a nonexperimental study, quantitative
   sociologists model one or more outcomes as a function of independent
   variables, interpreting the resulting parameter estimates as effects.
   This article compares the usual approach to causal inference in
   sociology with an alternative approach that builds explicitly on a
   counterfactual account of causation. The comparison is relevant because
   sociologists typically interpret (incorrectly) parameter estimates
   obtained using the first approach as supporting causal statements that
   are counterfactual. To make matters concrete, the author reconsiders an
   attainment model of Featherman and Hauser, who are interested in
   comparing the effects of family background on achievement, by sex and
   time. This analysis suggests the coefficients in the regressions of
   respondent's education and occupational status on background should not
   be interpreted as effects. However because a child's sex is determined
   without regard for his or her subsequent achievements, sex may be viewed
   as randomly assigned, justifying treating sex as the cause and the
   background variables as covariates. Unfortunately, the way in,which the
   data were collected preclude such a treatment.

AB The article shows the affinity of Simmel's formal sociology with
   Husserl's notion of eidetic science. This thesis is demonstrated by the
   corroboration of Simmel's revision of neo-kantian epistemology for
   sociology with Husserl's phenomenology, and the parallel discussion of
   Simmel and Husserl concerning cognitive levels and exact and
   morphological eide. Simmel's analysis of dyads is explored as an
   exemplar of his eidetic insights. An important consequence of this
   demonstration is the vindication establishing the scientific legitimacy
   of Simmel's methodology regarding the sociology of the forms of
   association. Woven throughout is discussion concerning the doctrine of
   the complementarity of eidetic and empirical science. Simmel's
   methodology is shown to have been ahead of its time through conjoining
   these two modes of scientific investigation.

AB Why and to what extent do people make significant purchases from people
   with whom they have prior noncommercial relationships? Using data from
   the economic sociology module of the 1996 General Social Survey, we
   document high levels of within-network exchanges. We argue that
   transacting with social contacts is effective because it embeds
   commercial exchanges in a web of obligations and holds the seller's
   network hostage to appropriate role performance in the economic
   transaction. It follows that within-network exchanges will be more
   common in risky transactions that are unlikely to be repeated and in
   which uncertainty is high. The data support this view. Self-reports
   about major purchases are consistent with the expectation that exchange
   frequency reduces the extent of within-network exchanges. Responses to
   questions about preferences for in-group exchanges support the argument
   that uncertainty about product and performance quality leads people to
   prefer sellers with whom they have noncommercial ties. Moreover, people
   prefer to avoid selling to social contacts under the same conditions
   that lead buyers to seek such transactions; and people who transact with
   friends and relatives report greater satisfaction with the results than
   do people who transact with strangers, especially for risk-laden
   exchanges.

   argues that internships help students achieve the educational goals of

   opportunity to apply the sociological perspective to a "real world"
   setting. They also enable students to improve their analytical skills
   and their ability to make use of "the sociological imagination" (Mills
   1959). Like any instructional method, professors must carefully plan and
   structure internships to ensure that they are effective. Whenever
   possible, internships should require: (II careful site selection, (2) a
   detailed learning agreement or contract, (3) attendance in a concurrent
   seminar, and (4) a set of cumulative assignments or a portfolio for
   evaluation.

   information from one historical period to illuminate another. It begins
   by showing how the strengths and weaknesses of methods commonly used to
   compare institutions or regions reappear in comparisons between times.
   The discussion then turns to alternative approaches. The use of
   narrative and of path dependency to construct explanatory sequences are
   strategies that strike a welcome balance between causal generalization
   and historical detail. But these approaches typically fail to identify
   either the causal mechanisms or the trajectories that link events in
   different eras. These gaps can be filled by rethinking sequences of
   events across periods as reiterated problem solving. Successive U.S.
   industrial relations regimes since 1900 are used to illustrate this
   methodological strategy.

AB Influenced by classical sociology, constructionist tradition and Pierre
   Bourdieu's writings, this article examines the capital of Russian
   bankers who are perceived as the prime movers of Russia's transition to
   the market. The bankers were selected as subjects for analysis because
   they represent profit-making enterprises in a country where money and
   capital had pejorative meanings prior to the recent capitalist-style
   reforms. It was not money but social relations that served as a primary
   medium of exchange in the Soviet system. Exploring what constitutes the
   major 'currency' in the new Russia, this article also questions whether
   the bankers' constructions of self and society differ from the
   prevailing code of the Russian/Soviet cultural repertoire that is seen
   as anti-individualistic, anti-materialistic and anticapitalist. Relying
   upon a survey of 484 bankers and 61 interviews with managers from Moscow
   and St Petersburg commercial banks, the article comes to the conclusion
   that these bankers possess substantial holdings in the form of money and
   social resources, and are also culturally well equipped for market
   experiences. However, their economic, social and cultural capital is
   only partially converted into symbolic capital interpreted as the most
   universal form of capital. Inadequacy of symbolic capital may question
   the legitimacy of other economic, social and cultural assets, and have
   negative repercussions for market-building in Russia.

AB Lifetime employment was a cornerstone of the Chinese socialist system
   constructed under Mao. In this system organizations served the function
   of social security and as a result, many organizations were overburdened
   with bloated work forces and retirees that drew from organizational
   coffers well into old age. Labor contracts fundamentally alter this
   system, as they allow firms to end the socialist institution of lifetime
   employment. Yet there is significant variation on the
   institutionalization of labor contracts in organizations. Based on a
   sample of 81 films in industrial Shanghai, I show that organizations
   that are experiencing uncertainty in the economic transition are more
   likely to institutionalize labor contracts on an organizationwide basis.
   There are two types of ol organisational uncertainty in the economic
   transition: economic uncertainty and administrative uncertainty In cases
   of economic uncertainty, firms that lost money in 1990 and firms that
   are burdened by large forces of retired workers are more likely to place
   their workers on labor contracts. In the case of administrative
   uncertainty firms that are at the highest levels of the industrial
   hierarchy are also significantly more likely to place their workers on
   labor contracts. Although these upper level firms were the most
   protected under the command economy: these are being forced to handle
   the greatest among the responsibilities in the economic transition and
   as a result, they experience the greatest sense of being set adrift by
   the state.

AB An important segment of writings on postindustrialization is distinctly
   utopian in stressing the greater mastery and control made possible by
   recent innovations in information technology. The utopian theme
   underscores the technical outcomes of innovations and highlights their
   benefits for ameliorating social problems. By contrast, our work
   suggests that many of the social problems in contemporary society are a
   consequence of recent innovations in information technology. We argue
   that postindustrial theorists are correct in stressing mastery over
   certain technical problems but incorrect in slighting the destabilizing
   effect innovations have on organizations and the markets in which these
   organizations participate. These destabilizing effects complicate
   organizational strategies by increasing market risk and uncertainty.
   Since most organizations are risk aversive, social problems are created
   as organizations externalize their costs and pass along risk to other,
   more dependent actors. Illustrations from two institutions, politics and
   the economy, indicate that many postindustrial innovations are
   associated with heightened competition as well as greater risk and
   uncertainty across the institutional order. We conclude that
   postindustrial technology introduces no net gain in managing the
   complexities of the social world. Risk and control are both integral to
   technological innovation and constitute the paradox of
   postindustrialization.

   status accrued by symbolic tools. Additionally, the role standardization
   has played in the development of engineering as a profession is explored
   in historical context as are the recurring themes of speed and "the

   world of messy practice and their conceptual framework regarding
   so-called "high technology" do not map well onto one another. The study
   illustrates the perspective of science and technology studies that views

   come from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of Bulgarian
   SOEs for the period fr-om 1989 (the last year under communism) to 1993
   (three years after major macroeconomic shifts). We investigate how
   changes in authority structure, work organization, technology marketing
   strategy, and organizational boundaries during these years affected
   organizational performance in 1993. We also assess the degree of path
   dependence in performance and the role of competitive industry
   conditions. Numerous organizational changes made by SOEs during early
   transition had little effect on performance. Yet organizational
   performance from 1989 to 1993 was highly path-dependent, although this
   dependence was mediated by the competitive conditions: Stronger markets
   displayed less path dependence. Overall the results favor the
   interpretations derived from selected neo-institutional and ecological

AB This article explores the ways that the feminist organization
   Sociologists for Women in Society(SWS) has become an arena of change in

   We begin with an examination of feminist models of power and change,
   followed by a brief history of SWS and an exploration of the use of
   power in sociology, academia, and beyond. We find that SWS has
   influenced both the organizational governance structures of sociology
   (such as the American Sociological Association) and the production of
   sociological scholarship. As a result, the presence of women is more
   apparent than ever before, and sociological paradigms are more inclusive
   and attentive to the voices of "outsiders." Academic institutions have

   women's experiences in the academy. Beyond the discipline and academia,
   SWS strives to participate in the making of public policy that affects
   women's lives and to be a presence both domestically and internationally
   in issues affecting the status and well-being of women. We conclude with
   the recommendation that sociologists use their experiences and knowledge

AB This article traces the impact of philosophical questions regarding the
   grounds of moral autonomy and heteronomy (rule-from-another as opposed
   to rule-from-oneself) on classical sociological theory, arguing that
   both Weber and Durkheim understood sociology to have a contribution to
   make in the debate,with Kant over the grounds of ethical action. Both
   insisted that the only possible ethical action was one within the bounds
   of rational knowledge that was inherently authoritative, but this sat
   uneasily with their focus on the relation between concrete social
   authority and the authoritativeness of beliefs in the sociology of
   religion. In rejecting Comte's explicit avowal of the embodiment of
   moral authority in the secular priesthood of sociologist, Weber and
   Durkheim had to paper over the social authority supporting the
   formulation of this rational knowledge. Each then produced a sociology
   of knowledge without a well-specified mechanism, in turn encouraging the
   development of the sociology of knowledge as ct flawed sub-discipline.

AB This paper proposes a sociology of the person that focuses upon the
   socially defined, publicly visible beings of intersubjective experience.
   I argue that the sociology of the person proposed by Durkheim and Mauss
   is more accurately described as a sociology of institutions of the
   person and neglects both folk or ethnopsychologies of personhood and the
   international production of persons. I draw upon the work of Goffman to
   develop a sociology of the person concerned with means, processes, and
   relations of person production. I also propose that the work of Goffman,
   Foucault, and others provides insights into the contemporary technology
   of person production and into how its control and use affects relations
   of person production. I conclude with a brief outline of the theoretical
   connections among institutions of the person, folk psychologies, the
   social constitution of the person, and the prospect of a distinctively
   sociological psychology.

   associated with using a laptop computer and presentation software during
   lectures. This discussion is informed by our own experience as well as
   end of the semester grades and student course evaluations from six
   sections of introductory social statistics that were taught between the
   fail of 1995 and the spring of 1997. Direct student quotes are used
   throughout the paper to emphasize particular points and to provide
   insight into students' perspectives on the computer presentations. Based
   on this objective and subjective evidence, we conclude that computer
   presentations can act as useful tools in courses like social statistics
   and methods. These presentations encourage classroom interaction,
   heighten interest, and provide a structure to lectures that can
   facilitate student comprehension and performance. This article also
   discusses potential problems that arise when using this technology.

AB I seek to explain the emergence of social differentiation by developing
   a theory of information and social structure. This theory makes
   explanations of social differentiation offered by Spencer and Durkheim
   more precise by borrowing simple assumptions from Carley's constructural
   model and from the symbolic interactionist perspective. My arguments
   amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption
   of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of
   social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple
   assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social
   construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally
   undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time.
   The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural
   homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or
   the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the
   information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory
   positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social
   differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated
   social systems such as organizations and societies. I consider
   implications of this theory for the origins of sociodemographic
   dimensions, the study of inequality, and the sociology of culture.

AB Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to objectively
   measure. This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that
   typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors.
   Systematic errors, or "biases," are the focus of this paper. Campbell
   and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the
   best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors,
   but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding
   for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We
   show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more
   relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can
   examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the
   potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic
   errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
   subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR
   papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the
   reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for
   comparable-worth investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do
   far more to understand the systematic error present in their subjective
   variables.

   bases of religious authority, secularization and rational choice depends
   in large part on Western models of religion, of the relationship between
   the individual and society, and on key Western values. These are not
   shared by other traditions. Classical Confucianism provides sociological
   models, core concepts and values that are distinctly different from
   those of the West. It has the potential to generate a sociology of
   religion altogether unlike the one to which we are accustomed. This

AB Organizational ethnographies have provided many insights about the

   survey methods. To extend their use from generating ideas to testing
   theories, I code and analyze data on organizational characteristics and
   workplace experiences from the existing population of English-language
   ethnographies (N = 108). The analysis confirms existing understandings,
   such as the importance of job autonomy for pride and effort. The
   analysis also generates new findings, including the finding of a
   positive influence of organizational effectiveness on both coworker
   relations and relations with management. Methodological checks indicate
   that data from organizational ethnographies can be coded reliably and
   without bias. However, the initial ethnographic observations differ
   somewhat based on ethnographers' theoretical orientations and time spent
   in the field The article concludes with a discussion of possible
   extensions of the analysis to other subfields in sociology that have
   accumulated bodies of ethnographic observation.

AB Research on the science enterprise ordinarily assumes that any hierarchy
   among academic departments reflects an egalitarian system based on
   merit. This assumption is predicated on the view that departmental
   prestige is primarily a function of faculty scholarship. In this
   article, the association between prestige and scholarship is examined
   for the discipline of sociology using evaluative ratings from three
   national studies and objective data on publications. Scholarship is
   found to be far less important in determining prestige ratings than
   either the past reputations of departments or their affiliated
   universities. Publishing is not necessarily a straightforward means of
   securing a department's prestige. Instead past reputation reflective of
   an institutional context, rather than scholarly productivity, appears to
   be the critical property bearing on how departments are viewed.

AB This paper explains the manipulation of small-holding peasants by

   the institutional practice of class rule in Ireland (see Fernand Braudel
   [1980] On History, Chicago: University of Chicago; Theda Skocpol [1979]
   States and Social Revolutions, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).
   Small-holding peasants and middle-class groups sought to reform the
   feudal practice of jurisdictional privileges by the greater gentry of
   Anglo-Irish landlords. A middle-class group of Irish nationalists
   exercised their "hegemony" over small-holding peasants during a social
   movement for Catholic Emancipation in the 1820s (see Antonio Gramsci
   [1975] Selections from the Prisons Notebooks, New York: International
   Publishers). The outcomes of this social movement included the political
   empowerment of Catholic "whigs" to reform the feudal practices of
   corporations in Irish towns and the frustration of peasant interests to
   reform the feudal practices of Anglo-Irish landlordism in the
   countryside.

AB In previous work, we have noted a certain rigidity in sociology's
   approach to the topic of social relations (Cerulo 1997; Cerulo and Ruane
   1997; Cerulo, Ruane, and Chayko 1992). With few exceptions, literature
   on the subject dichotomizes social relations with reference to the scope
   of the interaction (small group versus large group) and the mode by
   which social actors connect (direct connections versus mediated
   connections). Further, many researchers implicitly rank the social value
   of each relational form. Sociologists typically identify a society's
   primary and most valuable relations as the result of direct, physically
   copresent exchange, exchange involving relatively few interactants. In
   contrast, secondary relations often are characterized as faceless,
   impersonal, ingenuous, and fleeting-the result of large-group exchange
   established via mediated or mechanized connections. Cerulo (1997)
   suggested the need to reformulate any definition of social relations
   built upon the small group/large group or the direct/mediated
   dichotomies. She presented several critical elements upon which new
   definitions could be built. In this piece, we configure those elements,
   building six new analytic taxonomies-tools we hope will provoke a richer
   discussion of connecting, interacting, and resulting forms of social
   relations.

AB A certain type of film, the "genre stretcher," is of special interest to
   the sociology of deviance because it captures deviantizing discourse as
   if in a moment of crisis. A crisis in moral representation is at issue
   and with it the capacity for rendering symbolically coherent social
   action and cultural differentiation through narrative. This article
   investigates two instances of a genre stretcher-Tightrope (1983) and
   Cruising (1980)-and places analytic emphasis on interpreting their
   distinctive persona, the "inverted detective." This figure encases
   features of an emergent moral imagination in its condensation of certain
   conundrums, especially the problem of reinscribing deviance in a
   poststigma surround. The films thereby animate and trace out the
   implications of a discourse that was initiated by the 1960s and 1970s
   "revolt against stigma"; they function as allegories of the relations
   between normality and deviance amid symbolic instability.

   reflect winter and spring peaks, with indication of the spring peak
   dissipating more recently. Seasonal mortality patterns show a tendency
   for younger people to die in late summer and older people to die in late
   winter. Contrary to national patterns, we found female deaths exceeding
   male deaths in the 10-64 age group. As expressions of gender bias,
   females are disproportionately identified on gravestones in terms of
   familial relationships. Of the different cemetery types surveyed (1

   cemeteries continue to be used, suggesting a sectarian role in

AB Log-linear models are useful for analyzing cross-classifications of
   counts arising in sociology, but it has been argued that in some cases,
   an alternative approach for formulating models-one based on
   simultaneously modeling univariate marginal logits and marginal
   associations-can lead to models that are more directly relevant for
   addressing the kinds of questions arising in those cases. In this
   article, the authors explore some of the similarities and differences
   between the log-linear models approach to modeling categorical data and
   a marginal modeling approach. It has been noted in past literature that
   the model of statistical independence is conveniently represented within
   both approaches to specifying models for cross-classifications of
   counts. The authors examine further the extent to which the two families
   of models overlap, as well as some important differences. The authors do
   not present a complete characterization of the conditions describing the
   intersection of the two families of models but cover many of the models
   for bivariate contingency tables and for three-way contingency tables
   that are routinely used in sociological research.

   also contributes to research on stroke patients' "pathological crying"
   from the field of neuropsychology because it concentrates on the social,

   such crying. We first present overviews of both the sociology of

AB Corporate innovation is often argued to result from, and be encouraged
   by, market competition. The tradition is to test such arguments with
   market concentration data; firms with stronger control over their market
   can afford the long-run investment of R&D. Network theory has broadened
   our understanding of how competition is a function of structure within
   and beyond a market. Producers earn high profit margins to the extent
   they are few and their customers and suppliers are many and
   disorganized. The first condition is measured by the traditional
   concentration ratio for a market. The second condition is measured by
   the network constraint of suppliers and customers. My purpose in this
   paper is to describe how our understanding of the market competition
   effect on innovation is enriched when the concentration measure of
   marker competition tradition in economics is replaced with the network
   model of market competition now prevalent in sociology. Results indicate
   that markets facing competitive environments, in high constraint market
   positions, show greater R&D intensity and faster rates of innovation
   than do industries facing less competitive pressure. These effects
   persist even with controls for technological opportunity and
   appropriability, in contrast to traditional models using only
   concentration data to measure competition. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Over the last decade, environmental sociology has produced a tremendous
   stream of research pertaining to environmental justice issues. In
   general, we now know that low income groups and communities of color are
   disproportionately exposed to toxic wastes. In this paper I argue that
   future research requires a shift in methodological approach. Learning
   how groups come to be exposed to toxic wastes requires an understanding
   of the organizational processes that shape decisions regarding
   production practices and regulatory enforcement strategies. I conclude
   by making three claims: (I) Documenting that disempowered groups are
   exposed to toxic wastes more than other groups is important.
   Disentangling whether race or class matters more is more dubious. (2) If
   we want to make claims about process, we should study process and not
   outcomes. (3) Insofar as we have to study outcomes, we should be more
   aware of which outcomes we want to study and what types of inferences we
   are able to draw from outcomes.

AB With the aim of contributing to a sociology of age, this essay develops
   framework for understanding age as accomplished, i.e., as something that
   is both a process and the outcome of ongoing interactional work. The
   common expression "act your age" provides the useful metaphor of
   performance. We perform our own age constantly, but we also give meaning
   to other ages and to age more generally in our actions and interactions,
   our beliefs and words and feelings, our social policies. This essay
   offers two routes to the conclusion that age is accomplished. The first
   involves drawing parallels between the study of age and the study of
   gender The second route uses Existing scholarship, which recognizes that
   age is far more social than chronological. I draw on work in the social
   constructionist, symbolic interactionist, and life course traditions to
   develop the framework of age-as-accomplished and to show its potential
   to organize much of what we already have leaned about age and aging.

   Relatively recently, however, as interest in hegemonic processes becomes
   more popular and critical theory gains new prominence, there is a

AB The socioeconomic gap between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas
   increased during the 1980s. We test three competing explanations for
   this trend during the 1980s: overdependence on manufacturing, especially
   in nonmetro labor markets, the emergence of producer services as st
   catalyst of socioeconomic growth, and federal spending. Using a model
   that is informed by a variety of perspectives in sociology and economic
   geography, and commuter zones (CZs) as spatial units of analysis, we
   estimate the effects of manufacturing concentration, producer service
   concentration, and federal spending on per capita income, per capita
   earnings, and private nonfarm employment growth during the 1983-1988
   business cycle recovery. The OLS and interaction models show that all
   three factors help explain why metro areas outperformed nonmetro areas
   during this time period. The effects of producer service concentration,
   however, best fit with our expectations. Implications of our findings
   are discussed.

AB This article suggests that American sociology has developed a defacto
   tradition in the sociology of the marked that devotes greater
   epistemological attention to "politically salient" and "ontologically
   uncommon" features of social life, Although the "unmarked" comprises the
   vast majority of social life, the "marked" commands a disproportionate
   share of attention from sociologists. Since the marked already draws
   more attention within the general culture, social scientists contribute
   to re-marking and the reproduction of common-sense images of social
   reality This has important analytic consequences. This article argues
   for developing a stronger tradition in a sociology of the unmarked that
   explicitly foregrounds "politically unnoticed" and taken-for-granted
   elements of social reality. Three strategies are proposed toward this
   end: (1) reversing conventional patterns of markedness to foreground
   what typically remains unnamed and implicit, (2) marking everything by
   filling in all the shades of social continue so that each shares the
   same degree of epistemological ornamentation, and (3) developing an
   analytically nomadic perspective that observes social phenomena from
   multiple vantage points.

AB Although the focus of their work was rarely explicitly sociological,
   Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari developed concepts that have important
   and often profound implications for social theory and practice. Two of
   these, sense and segmentarity provide us,with entirely new ways to view
   sociological problems of meaning and structure. Deleuze conceives sense
   independently of both agency and signification, That is, sense is
   neither the manifestation of a communicating subject nor a structure of
   language-it is noncorporeal, impersonal, and prelinguistic, in
   his,words, a "pure effect or event." With Guattari, Deleuze notes that
   it is not a question of how subjects produce social structures, but how
   a "machinics of desire" produces subjects. In Deleuze and Guattari,
   desire is not defined as a want or a lack, but as a machinery of forces,
   flows, and breaks of energy. The functional stratification we witness in
   social life is only the molar effect of a more primary segmentation of
   desire that occurs at the molecular level, at the level of bodies. In
   Deleuze and Guattari, bodies are not just human bodies, but "anorganic"
   composites or mixtures, organic form itself being a mode of the body's
   subjectification. The problem of the subject, and thus of the
   constitution of society, is first a problem of how the sense of bodies
   is produced through the assembly of desiring-machines. The subject, we
   could sag: is the actualization of desire on the incorporeal surface of
   bodies.

AB This paper reviews the origins and definitions of social capital in the
   writings of Bourdieu, Loury, and Coleman, among other authors. It
   distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their
   dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature
   emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits
   mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these
   positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also
   deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
   four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples.
   Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an
   individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final
   sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I
   argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability,
   social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However,
   excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.

   there are more than twenty computer programs designed to assist

   by researchers with a variety of epistemological orientations. Some
   computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDA) programs automate
   analysis procedures that have been used by generations of ethnographers.
   Others open up new directions through the use of linked coding schemes,

   in computer assistance must acquaint themselves with the variety of

AB The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of contemporary
   sociology in Japan. The sociological discipline in Japan has made
   remarkable progress since World War II. The rapid economic growth during
   the 1960s, which was prompted by Western influence, had an effect on the
   direction of the discipline's development. After providing a brief
   overview of historical events, I consider scholarly publications during
   the last 30 years to illuminate substantive trends in sociological
   research. As might be predicted, the changing substantive interests of
   Japanese sociologists have been in many ways a response to societal
   changes and needs. I also examine the trends in theory, methods, and
   empirical research. A content analysis of articles published in the
   major Japanese sociological journals shows the growing emphasis on
   theoretical scholarship and the decreasing emphasis on empirical
   research in recent years. The conclusion presents some considerations
   concerning the future direction of Japanese sociology.

PY 1998
AB The protection of habitat for an officially designated "threatened"
   species, the Northern Spotted Owl, is widely seen as having endangered
   the survival of a very different "species," namely the rural American
   logger. In spite of the widespread agreement on this point, however, it
   is not clear just how many jobs have been endangered, over just how long
   a period, due to the protection of spotted-owl habitat and of the
   environment more broadly. In the present paper, we analyze longer term
   employment trends in logging and milling, both nationally and in the two
   states of the Pacific Northwest where the spotted-owl debate has been
   most intense, to determine the length of time over which such
   environmental protection efforts have been creating the loss of logging
   and milling jobs. There are three potential key "turning points" since
   the start of high-quality employment data in 1947-the 1989 controversy
   over the federal "listing" of the Northern Spotted Owl under the
   Endangered Species Act, the earlier increase in environmental
   regulations accompanying the first Earth Day in 1970, and the
   still-earlier "locking up" of timber after the passage of the Wilderness
   Protection Act in 1964. We also examine the effects of two other
   variables that have received considerable attention in the ongoing
   debates-levels of U.S. Forest Service timber harvests and the exporting
   of raw logs. We find that the 1989 listing of the spotted owl has no
   significant effect on employment-not even in the two states where the
   debate has been most intense. Instead, the only statistically
   significant turning point came with the passage of the Wilderness Act in
   1964. The direction of the change, however, was precisely the opposite
   of what is generally expected. Both nationally and in the Pacific
   Northwest, the greatest decline in timber employment occurred from 1947
   until 1964-a time of great economic growth, a general absence of
   "unreasonable environmental regulations," and growing timber harvests.
   The period since the passage of the Wilderness Act has been one of
   increased complaints about environmental constraints, but much less
   decline in U.S. logging employment. If logging jobs have indeed been
   endangered by efforts to protect the environment in general and
   spotted-owl habitat in particular, what is needed is a plausible
   explanation of how the influence of the owls could have begun more than
   forty years before the species came under the protection of the
   Endangered Species Act.

PD 1998
PY 1998
AB This research incorporates the sociology of emotions into the study of
   parenting by examining the theoretical relationship between the mother
   identity and mothers' emotional response of jealousy to father-child
   interactions. Using identity theory, we predict that in response to
   father-child interactions, mothers with a more prominent mother identity
   will report the emotional experience of jealousy, and mothers with a
   more salient mother identity will report coping strategies designed to
   reduce the jealous experience. Since prominence captures the affective
   dimension of an identity, it should be tied to one's emotional response
   in a situation. Further, while salience captures the behavioral
   dimension of an identity, it should be related to the coping strategies
   which follow from and manage one's emotional response in a situation.
   The results confirm these expected relationships. We discuss not only
   how emotion may serve to maintain the mother identity, but also how
   mothers' emotion may unintentionally serve to maintain social structural
   arrangements with respect to parenting.

AB Research indicates that some of the most important factors in promoting
   individual development and academic achievement for undergraduate
   students are student involvement, student integration, and high effort
   at academic tasks (e.g., Astin 1984; Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini
   1991; Terenzini and Wright 1987). Student involvement and integration
   are often measured by frequency of academic and social interactions with
   faculty members, participation in student organizations, integration
   into the major program, and participation in research projects. These
   experiences can be conceived of as part of the academic and professional
   socialization of students and often occur outside the traditional
   college classroom. In this paper, we discuss the importance of these
   out-of-class experiences and review the literature on outcomes of this
   "other" or "informal" curriculum. In addition, we argue, by sharing some
   data on academic and professional socialization from students, faculty
   members, and departments, that most departments do not adequately
   provide these beneficial opportunities. After a discussion of barriers
   to providing these experiences, we conclude with a call, and some
   suggestions, for increasing these important learning opportunities for
   our undergraduate students.

AB Courses on quantitative research methods play a central role in many
   undergraduate programs in sociology. However, students' anxiety over the
   courses is a major concern for instructors. Many students perceive the
   subject as inherently uninteresting and difficult. This paper describes
   an experiment designed to introduce aspects of quantitative reasoning
   into a large substantively focused class in the social sciences. The
   experiment assessed whether students can learn quantitative reasoning
   skills in the context of a large "nonmethods" class in sociology. The
   experiment measured students' mastery of these skills by comparing their
   competence at quantitative reasoning at the beginning and end of the
   class term. The results revealed that students' abilities to interpret
   and manipulate empirical data increased significantly. Further, the
   increase occurred independent of students' basic reasoning skills as
   measured by baseline SAT verbal and math scores. This paper discusses
   the implications of these findings for teaching quantitative methods in
   sociology undergraduate curricula.

   membership in social groups. Much recent scholarship, however, has
   argued that political cleavages arising out of social group memberships
   have declined. This study investigates these claims, analyzing the
   magnitude of and interrelationship among four major social
   cleavages-race, religion, class, and gender-in U.S. presidential
   elections since 1960. We improve over dichotomous measures of religion
   and class and introduce statistical models that permit measurement of
   relative shifts in the vote choice of the core groups making up each
   cleavage. Our results do not support claims about the declining
   magnitude of social cleavages. The race cleavage has increased
   considerably since 1960, and the gender cleavage more modestly during
   this period, while the class cleavage has remained stable, and the
   religion cleavage has declined slightly. We find evidence of a slight
   increase in social group cleavages in presidential elections from 1960
   through 1992. Net of change in the race cleavage, the overall social
   cleavage has been stable during this period.

AB Data on the themes of international environmental treaties from 1870 to
   1990 are used to demonstrate an historical shift in the definition of
   "nature" from resource to life-sustaining global ecosystem. This newer
   scientific model increased nature's relevance to world society, and thus
   catalyzed an exponential rise in international discourse and activity
   concerning the environment. The effect is evident in event-history
   analyses of the rate at which international environmental treaties were
   formed during the period 1870-1990. Two organizational changes also
   played a role in the proliferation of international environmental
   treaties: the overall structuration of the world polity had a positive
   effect, and the consolidation of an official intergovernmental
   environmental domain had a negative effect, even with the effects of
   population growth and industrial degradation held constant.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of managerial social status on the
   normative evaluation of managerial acts in organizational contexts. We
   test several propositions on the relationship between social status and
   normative;evaluation derived from Donald Black's theoretical framework
   on social control. The research design consists of a factorial survey of
   200 managers. Each respondent evaluated the seriousness of a normatively
   questionable managerial act. In each vignette, the perpetrator's social
   status was systematically manipulated in either a high or a low
   condition. The results generally support the argument that the higher a
   manager's social status the less vulnerable that individual is to
   unfavorable normative evaluations, holding constant the act. The paper
   closes with discussion of our findings in light of social structural and
   rational choice perspectives on informal social control in
   organizations. Additionally, we discuss methodological issues related to
   experimental research on informal social control in organizations, the
   consistency of our findings with those from previous studies of social
   control across diverse settings, potential;theoretical applications and
   extensions of Black's framework in organizational contexts, and
   practical implications for the implementation of corporate codes of
   conduct and corporate dispute resolution systems.

AB One of the classic questions in urban sociology is how social relations
   and solidarity are maintained in an urbanized industrialized,
   bureaucratic society. The two pivotal research focuses have been the
   issues of(1) the persistence of territorially based affective ties and
   primary relations in an urban world and (2) the micro/macro links
   connecting community residents and the larger society. This article
   argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from
   affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals
   purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community
   in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating
   themselves with others who share their values and preferences and
   asserting their social status and social identity to others.

AB Although it is evident in his work from the beginning, Durkheim's
   epistemological argument did not appear in its completed form until the
   1912 publication of The Elementary Forms of the Religions Life. There
   Durkheim outlined a theory of enacted social practice as the foundation
   for an epistemology. Yet neither Durkheim's contribution to a theory of
   social practice nor his epistemological argument have been recognized as
   such. The early critics played a pivotal role in creating and
   perpetuating this misunderstanding. The first highly negative wave of
   criticism in English, which treated Durkheim's arguments as naive,
   inadequate philosophy, appeared between 1915 and 1924. Inadequate as
   these initial criticisms were, citations show that they have been
   heavily relied upon. On these critics' authority, scholars rejected
   Durkheim's epistemology altogether, focusing instead on his sociology of
   knowledge and sociology of religion.

   of symbolic resources during political debate over the 1969 revised
   Philadelphia Plan-a crucial moment in the shaping of federal equal
   employment law. Tying together political sociology's concept of policy
   feedback with legal and cultural sociology's concept of culture as a
   resource, the article explains how actors who were hampered by the
   explicit language used to embed equal opportunity values into law turned
   apparent constraint into an opportunity to transform law. The article
   simultaneously illuminates an underdeveloped aspect of equal employment
   law's unfolding and builds more general theory to help explain how law's
   language, general cultural values expressed in law, and alternative
   methods used to interpret law mediate the effects of past law on future
   law. Defining concepts of value centrality and explicitness of legal
   language, the article uses its case study to suggest hypotheses about
   how variation in centrality of cultural values and explicitness of
   language used to incorporate these values into law affect variation in
   mobilization of different types of cultural strategies by actors
   struggling over law interpretation and enforcement.

AB For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx
   are complementary, contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist
   society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's
   critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of
   reification, Georg Lukacs contended that the combination of Marx's and
   Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially
   transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By
   comparing Lukacs's theory of reification with Habermas's theory of
   communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian
   Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of "doing theory" has shifted
   from Marx's critique of economic deter terminism to Weber's idea of the
   inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an
   important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself
   as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions
   of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social
   value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second
   step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to
   Each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of
   communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of
   social organization.

AB The process is traced whereby crucially important, multiple denotations
   of classical sociology's key notion referring to social position-the
   Weberian German concept of Stand-have been stripped to create a
   simplified and inaccurate representation of social inequalities. Some
   historical material from central Europe is surveyed, with a brief look
   at Japan, to demonstrate validity problems created by blanket
   application of the culturally specific, streamlined notions of
   status/class. As an alternative, a notion of contingent social closure
   argues that relaxing the modernizationist assumptions of a single
   transition from estate to status/class increases the
   comparative-historical sensitivity of research on social structure,
   inequality, and stratification. A dynamic reading of Polanyi suggests a
   reconceptualization of institutions as the "raw material" of social
   change. This might help to avoid the outdated contrast of the "West" vs.
   its "Others".

   distance in correcting the structuralist and instrumentalist biases of

   limited, however. by their retention of dichotomous conceptions of
   culture and structure in the emergence of protest, of cultural and
   instrumental orientations in ongoing collective action, and of cultural
   and political targets of protest. As a result, they have neglected,
   respectively, continuities between structured inequalities and the
   movement challenges that are made to them, the cultural shaping of
   instrumentally rational decisionmaking, and the strategic possibilities
   that lay in cultural challenge made within the sphere of institutional
   politics. I draw on recent theorizing in the sociology of culture and on
   several case studies of collective action in order to highlight these
   lacunae and to propose analytical alternatives.

   author has developed a method that converts estimated parameters from

   model. This method makes it possible and easier for researchers to
   estimate the Yamaguchi model using standard statistical software and a

   fledgling discipline of sociology against medicine, psychiatry, and
   psychology; and advocates of therapy for addicts against those who would
   simply punish them. By casting the meaningful experience of drug effects
   exclusively in terms of symbolically mediated mental representations of
   brute physiological sensations, Lindesmith's theory posits an
   epistemologically untenable dualism between mental and bodily perception
   that unnecessarily limits the explanatory scope of sociological
   research. As an alternative to this dualism, a praxiological approach to
   the meaning of drug-induced behavior and experience is proposed.

AB The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has challenged many of the
   ''core'' conceptions of theory and method that remain entrenched in
   sociology textbooks. In conjunction with recent developments in history
   and philosophy of science, sociologists of science speak of the disunity
   of science and describe the local-historical origins of particular
   scientific facts and laws. ''Core'' sociology textbooks devote no
   attention to the methodological implications of recent sociology of
   science. Elementary textbooks present upbeat versions of the discipline
   that emphasize sociology's scientific methodology; they describe
   sociological methods as implementations of a general research process
   designed along hypothetico-dedective lines. Viewed from the vantage
   point of SSK, such widely disseminated elementary versions of sociology
   promote an asociological conception of science. In this paper we suggest
   that the ''epistemic flattening'' accomplished by SSK's research on the
   natural sciences provides a valuable antidote to current anxieties about
   the coherence and scientific status of sociology.

AB Emerging from recent social and political struggles, the notion of
   'civil society' can and should be transformed into a sociological
   concept on both the theoretical and empirical level. This means going
   beyond the Marxist and social democratic understandings of civil society
   as a world of selfish economic interests, on the one hand, and beyond
   the liberal equation of civil society with legal protections of
   individual rights, on the other. Civil society should be conceptualized
   as a realm of solidarity, a 'we-ness' that simultaneously affirms the
   sanctity of the individual and these individuals' obligations to the
   collectivity. The solidary sphere, in principle and in practice, can be
   differentiated not only from markets and states but from such other
   noncivil spheres as religion, family and science. Yet differentiation
   does not preclude tension and conflict over boundaries. Civil solidarity
   is 'compromised' and 'distorted' by these boundary relations, and also
   by competing, more primordial definitions of community, such as race,
   language, nation, territory, and ethnicity. While civil society can be
   identified with 'universal reason' in a philosophical sense, in
   sociological terms it must be articulated by more concrete and
   identity-related symbolic constructs. For this reason, sociological
   approaches to civil society must be tied to cultural sociology, to
   theories of symbolic codes and narratives.

   of Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Published in
   1937 to lukewarm reviews, the novel is currently considered a core
   canonical text. We specify three processes involved in the
   reconstruction of Hurston's novel and in the establishment of the
   African American literary canon: (I) the application of new evaluative
   criteria, (2) the reconstruction of textual meaning through newly
   available interpretative strategies, and (3) changes in the
   institutional and organizational environment that allowed new claims on
   high-status critical positions to be made by those previously outside
   the literary hierarchy. The implications of this study for theoretical
   models of cultural valorization in sociology are considered.

AB This article argues that the medical record is an important focus for
   sociological research. In medical work, the modern patient's body that
   Foucault has so aptly described is produced through embodied, materially
   heterogeneous work, and the medical record plays a crucial role in this
   production. It does not simply represent this body's history and
   geography; it is a central element in the material rewriting of these.
   Simultaneously, the record fulfills a core role in the production of a
   body politic. As the record is involved in the performance of the
   patient's body, it is also involved in the performance of the clinic in
   which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that different records
   and different practices of reading and writing are intertwined with the
   production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic, and bodies of
   knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical record affords
   the interplay and coordination of divergent worlds. Seen as a site where
   multiple stories about patients and organizations are at stake,
   including the interoperability between these stories, the medical record
   becomes highly relevant both analytically and politically.

AB Medical sociology ranges from studies of formal medical care to those of
   health, healing, and caring practices outside the health care system
   This field has had a history of ethnographic and qualitative research
   since ifs beginnings. Because few studies in medical sociology derive
   from immersion in a setting, the authors examine those qualitative works
   in which researchers and subjects had sustained contact. They focus only
   on major areas in which ethnographic contributions have clustered: (1)
   disability, chronic illness, and terminal illness; (2) caring and
   curing; (3) medical sociology in aging research; (4) socialization into
   health care professions; and (5) the ethnography of ethics. Throughout
   this review, the added value of ethnographic research to each specific
   area is noted. Ethnographic research has enriched medical sociology with
   its emphasis an descriptive detail, meanings, ongoing processes, and
   concepts. The article ends with a discussion of methodological
   considerations for conducting research and a summary statement.

AB Following Hobbes, many social theorists have claimed that the state
   reduces the amount of violence in human societies. Are they right? I
   review the cross-cultural and cross-national evidence on the impact of
   the state on the most common form of extreme violence-lethal conflict
   (i.e., war, rebellion, homicide, and execution). Drawing on the
   sociology of conflict management (Black 1993), I argue that the
   relationship between the state and lethal conflict is nor negative as
   Hobbesian theory predicts. Rather, it appears to be U-shaped. A
   combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political
   science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when
   state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or
   centralized. Between these extremes, in less centralized states, lethal
   conflict typically declines.

   addressing broader multicultural curriculum transformation issues. This
   course uses a systems of inequality approach. The selection of
   compatible reading materials is discussed, as is the challenge of
   introducing small-group work to provide more direct exposure to the
   privileges and disadvantages in students' lives. Four semesters of
   small-group work are summarized in the content analyses of students'
   responses to four questions: What is a source of pride in your
   racial/ethnic background When have you been discriminated against? When
   have you discriminated against others? How are you privileged? Results
   reveal an implied white racism, frank gender discrimination toward
   women, a tendency to personalize and individualize discrimination toward
   others, and perceived class privilege with regard to education. These
   findings are discussed within the context of the systems of inequality
   approach, within the context of the course, and within the wider

   augmented by various on-site discussants, the semester-long curriculum
   integrated sociology and political economy with agricultural ecology.
   Our guiding philosophy dictated that the curriculum be empirically
   based, involve working collaboratively, and utilize multidisciplinary
   investigation. Faculty members and students worked together in a number
   of sites throughout the country to investigate the human and
   environmental problems of sustainability. Students were open to
   interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field
   reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is
   challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that
   this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This
   report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also
   considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a

AB A recent report of the American Sociological Association calls for
   revision of the sociology major to promote greater ''study in depth.'' A
   key recommendation in the report is that the major include at least four
   levels of sequencing. These consist of introductory courses, skills
   courses, advanced substantive courses, and capstone courses. St. Cloud
   State University revised its sociology major to incorporate many of the
   recommendations in the ASA report. An initial revision of the major
   omitted the third level of sequencing, but a recent revision includes
   all four levels. Faculty members concerns about scheduling, enrollments,
   and autonomy slowed the pace of change and influenced the content of the
   major. The experience of St. Cloud State University suggests that
   implementing the ''study in depth'' guidelines is a difficult but
   rewarding process.

AB Postmodernism charges that sociological methods project ways of thinking
   and being from the past onto the future, and that sociological forms of
   presentation are rhetorical defenses of ideologies. Postmodernism
   contends that sociological theory presents reified constructs no more
   based in reality than are fictional accounts. Kenneth Burke's logology
   predates and adequately addresses postmodernism's valid charges against
   sociology. At the same time, logology avoids the idealistic tendencies
   and ethical pitfalls of radical forms of postmodernist deconstruction,
   which acknowledge neither pretextual and extratextual worlds nor the way
   sin which experience is embodied. While not fully articulated, Burke's
   logology gives primacy to an embodies, social world prior to text
   (body-as-World). Sociology can strengthen both its theoretical arsenal
   and its response to postmodernism by reacknowledging and reclaiming
   Burke's logology.

AB Epistemological reflection has been a major source of innovation in the
   human sciences while having very little influence on the arts of
   sciences. This variation is explained using a sociological framework
   emphasizing the organizational forms that underpin or are implicit in
   epistemological positions. The fine arts and the harder sciences are,
   respectively, too weakly and too strongly organized to be open to
   epistemological influence. By contrast, the human sciences might
   plausibly be organized either more loosely or more tightly, and
   epistemological argument is used in part to urge movement in one or the
   other direction. This persvective is applied to the academic study of
   literature both historically and in relation to a current
   epistemological dispute between realist and relativist scholars. The
   argument is unresolvable in practice, it is argued, because of
   constraints on scholarly interpretation set by consumers. Parallels are
   drawn with circumstances in sociology.

AB State autonomy is often viewed as the result of the culture, ideological
   coherence, or class background of the state bureaucracies, and of
   institutional characteristics that ensure state effectiveness. This view
   has several problems: it assumes what has to be explained, makes it
   difficult to understand changes in state autonomy, and tends to make
   autonomy the characteristic of strong, cove states. This paper calls for
   a new approach to study state autonomy, one in which power is a
   characteristic of a relationship, not of actors or organizations
   (Emerson 1962), and uses this approach to examine changes in state-class
   relationships based on taxation during the mid 1930s in Bolivia. The
   paper then argues that state autonomy depends on the relative costs of
   state policies and on the availability of political allies to the state
   vis-a-vis the opposing economic elite. This approach allows us to
   specify the power dependence of the state on a gir,en class, the
   conditions under which that relative dependence changes in favor of the
   state, and is applicable to both weak and strong states.

AB ''Stacking'' is one of the oldest and most thoroughly studied phenomena
   in the sociology of sport. Because of this tradition, the literature is
   replete with tabular demonstrations of the stacking phenomenon Many of
   these data arrangements violate an important convention in table
   presentation: Percents should be computed in the direction of the causal
   factor. This procedure allows one to contrast the distribution of the
   dependent variable between/among categories of the independent variable
   and enables determining what differences if any, exist between/among
   categories of the independent variable. The consequences of this
   violation for stacking studies is that, technically, position appears to
   affect race whereas, logically race affects position played. Because so
   many competent researchers have published tables that run the ''wrong
   way,'' it is appropriate to examine the rationale behind the cause and
   effect rule for percentaging tables and instances in which this ''rule''
   may be broken.

   andragogical teaching techniques for a multidisciplinary classroom.
   Field research was conducted by undergraduate students at a popular
   social setting: local urban and suburban malls. The objective of the
   assignment was to explore critically the basic sociological concepts of
   stratification along such dimensions as race, class, gender, ethnicity,
   and nationality. By extending classroom heuristics into the social world
   of ''everyday life,'' this approach enables students to explore a
   familiar social place-the postindustrial shrine to American consumption
   culture-through the critical lens of the sociological imagination. The
   application of sociological principles learned in the classroom to the
   larger community or ''real world'' helps to enhance the relevance of
   sociology as a scientific discipline to students when they return to the
   traditional academic setting. Although the paper is based on experiences
   from a multidisciplinary class (N=63) that was not trained in
   qualitative research techniques, the assignment can be utilized
   effectively in more advanced undergraduate and graduate courses,
   including research methods classes.

AB Economic stratification and social class occupy a central position in
   sociological discourse as the core organizing features of modern
   societies. Yet such economically centered models of stratification often
   disregard factors like physical violence and the intra-household
   distribution of resources that shape power and autonomy for all groups.
   Using a sample of textbooks from 1983 through 1988, we examine
   ''mainstream'' sociology, that is, the sociology that teachers,
   students, and textbook publishers have treated as nonproblematic. We
   show how stratification analysis is applied to class, race, and gender
   in profoundly unequal ways. Rather than integrating macro, meso, and
   micro levels of social structure as interactive and mutually
   determinative in their discussions of race, class, and gender,
   introductory sociology textbooks segregate stratification processes.
   They discuss class at the societal (or macro) level of analysis, gender
   at the individual (or micro) level, and race at a group (or meso) level.
   We analyze the quantitative and qualitative elements of the coverage of
   class, race, and gender in indexes, texts, pictures, and captions, and
   suggest that attention to feminist theories of gender would produce a
   more integrated, multilevel, and interactive view. of stratification.

AB Two population surveys of Mexico City residents were conducted, the
   first three weeks after the earthquake of September 1985 and the other a
   year later. We found that: (1) small percentages, because of the size of
   the metropolitan area population, translated into large absolute numbers
   for personal disaster behavior; (2) social class (or socioeconomic
   status) was important as a differentiating factor in earthquake-related
   behavior; (3) there was little dissatisfaction with organizational
   efforts to deal with the earthquake consequences along with (4) no
   noticeable increase in dissatisfaction from the time of the initial
   impact up to the year's anniversary of the disaster; (5) the
   earthquake-related sheltering and housing of people was not as
   problematical as the extensiveness of the activity might suggest; (6)
   the volunteering pattern of individuals was quite complex; (7) there was
   extremely heavy mass media usage in the earthquake aftermath; and (8)
   earthquake victims learned little from their experience on how to
   prepare for future disasters. The paper primarily uses these
   generalizations from the survey findings to advance eight basic themes
   about human behavior in disasters that might be comparatively examined
   in future cross-societal studies.

AB The need to better understand landlord involvement in decision-making
   related to pesticide use and water quality issues is evidenced by
   several trends. These trends include the increasing documentation of
   water pollution by farm pesticides, the changing characteristics of farm
   ownership and operator tenure, and evolutions in resource policy and
   protection planning. This paper utilizes a theoretical approach to the
   sociology of land tenure to interpret results from an investigation of
   landlord involvement in environmental decision making regarding
   pesticide selection on rented land. Eight counties with high
   susceptibility of water contamination by pesticides were selected for
   study. Structured, in-person interviews were administered to in-county
   landlords, and a mail survey was used to poll out-of-county landlords.
   Results indicate that participation is generally low with very little
   difference between landlord groups. Renters make most of the
   organizational and operational decisions on rented farmland. Landlord
   participation is predominantly based on economic, rather than on social
   or environmental, factors. Furthermore, while economic variables are
   important predictors of participation for both groups, gender and social
   ties to the renter tend to increase local landlord involvement, but not
   absentee involvement. These results have important implications for both
   federal programs and further research on land tenure and environmental
   stewardship.

AB For three decades Oscar Lewis's subculture of poverty concept has been
   misinterpreted as a theory bent on blaming the victims of poverty for
   their poverty. This essay corrects this misunderstanding. Using a
   sociology of knowledge approach, it explores the historical origins of
   this misreading and shows hotel current poverty scholarship replicates
   this erroneous interpretation of Lewis's work. An attempt is made to
   remedy this situation by arguing that Lewis's subculture of poverty
   idea, far from being a poor-bashing, ideological ploy, is firmly
   grounded in a Marxist critique of capital and ifs productive
   contradictions. As such, Lewis's work is a celebration of the resilience
   and resourcefulness of the poor, not a denigration of the lower class
   and the cultural defenses they erect against poverty's everyday
   uncertainty.

AB With his recent introduction of "posthumanism," a decentered variant of
   constructivist sociology of science, Andrew Pickering advertises novel
   conceptual resources for social theorists. fn fact, he tenders nothing
   less than a fundamental reordering of social thought. By invoking the
   concept of "material agency," Pickering seeks to redefine the
   relationship between "Nature " and "Society," while dismissing the
   "humanist bias" inherent in sociological inquiry. However, for all its
   ambition and good intentions, posthumanism delivers only analytical
   inconsistencies, the consequences of an uneasy synthesis of pragmatist
   and poststructuralist influences. When translated into the language of
   conventional sociological theory, these problems surface as an
   inadequate treatment of human agency The works of the original
   pragmatists, particularly C.S. Peirce and G.H. Mead, illustrate how the
   objectives of posthumanism can be achieved without decentering,
   suggesting a renewed appreciation of "humanist" sociologies.

AB While the ''new institutionalism'' has emersed as a dominant theory of

   its possible limits. Under what circumstances might the neoinstitutional
   predictions regarding organizational inertia, institutional isomorphism,
   the legitimacy imperative, and other fundamental beliefs be overshadowed
   by? more traditional sociological theories accentuating organizational
   adaptation, variation, and the role of specific global and local
   technical environmental demands? We analyze longitudinal data from 1971
   to 1986 for 631 private liberal arts colleges facing strong
   institutional and increasingly strong technical environments. Our
   findings reveal surprisingly little support neoinstitutional
   predictions. (I) Many liberal arts colleges changed in ways contrary to
   institutional demands by professionalizing or vocationalizing their
   curricula; (2) global and local technical environmental conditions, such
   as changes in consumers' references and local economic and demographic
   differences, were strong predictors of the changes observed; (3) schools
   Became less, rather than more, homogeneous over time; (4) schools
   generally did not mimic their most prestigious counterparts; (5) the
   illegitimate changes had no negative (and often had positive)
   performance consequences for enrollment and survival. Our results
   suggest that current research on organization-environment relations map
   underestimate the power of traditional adaptation-based explanations in
   organizational sociology.

AB This paper briefly outlines the origins and contributions of
   environmental sociology to date, going on to propose ways in which the
   existing research can be used as a foundation for a new generation of
   research into the 21st century. It argues that environmental
   sociologists need to avoid the omphaloskepsis that sometimes afflicts
   other fields of sociology, but that there is a real opportunity to do
   so. Three options appear particularly promising: (a) broadening the
   now-established base of sociological research that deals systematically
   with environmental variables; (b) devoting greater attention to the ways
   in which socially constructed ''definitions of the situation'' may
   contribute to (and not simply permit the evading of) the environmental
   problems that societies face; and (c) beginning more line-grained
   analyses of the connections between specific human activities
   (particularly economic activities) and specific components of the
   physical environment. Contributions to date have clearly established the
   fact that such connections exist; the work of a much broader range of
   sociologists will be needed, however, to help develop an improved
   understanding oi the nature, causes, and extent of those connections.

   this is easier in theory than in practice. Most discussions of
   objectives are quite abstract, suggest an additive, linear understanding
   of learning, and present a false dichotomy between content and skills.
   Schema theory can help us overcome these limitations by recasting
   objectives in terms of active learning outcomes. An extended example of
   this approach is discussed.

   extensive and broad; however, it is ghettoized, with the majority of
   citations confined to a chapter on race. Ghettoization is coupled with a
   pattern of topical coverage that finds most references to race-ethnicity
   clustered in a limited set of sociological topics. Together, these
   findings suggest that people of color are marginalized from many of the
   major concerns of the text. Newly published or revised texts appear to

AB East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.

   In investigating this transformation, I focus upon two cognitive
   processes: the splitting of the fetus apart from the pregnant woman and
   the concurrent lumping of two distinct mental entities-a fetus and an
   infant into one new medical category: the fetus-infant. In addition,
   textual evidence shows a shift in cognitive orientation away from
   classifying fetuses based on gestational age to an emphasis on what I
   term functional age. Further, new knowledge enables physicians to affect
   functional age, making the fetus with mature function in utero
   conceptually no different from a baby.

   hegemonic Western culture's intersubjective notions of how to carve lip

   sociologists of cognition have still to consider this sociomental

   and sociologists of time have still to consider ''menstrual time'' as a

   environment provides only inconsistent and ambiguous information,

   frameworks-the Cautious, Confident and Neutral frameworks-organize
   perceptions of safety and danger. Each framework begins with a default
   assumption about safety and danger and ''marks'' certain items as
   different from this default. In shaping expectations, these frameworks
   also contribute to perceptions of horror, humor, excitement and fear.
   Finally, I use these frameworks to analyze the psychological concept

   how recent work in the sociology of science suggests an equally
   important place for methodological preference in guiding social
   research. Bringing in method allows us to recognize that what often
   passes for fundamental metatheoretical differences among subfields in
   sociology actually consists of minor squabbles over resource allocation.
   We show that not only does social theory grow strategically through

AB Production systems are ordered sets of if-then rules linking knowledge
   and action. The authors show how these systems, developed and applied in
   artificial intelligence and cognitive science, can be used to construct
   empirically based symbolic interactionist models of situated human
   interaction. The authors argue that production system models enhance the
   conceptual clarity and formal analytic capabilities of key ideas in
   Herbert Blumer's methodological directives for sociology's symbolic
   interactionist perspective. The authors present both a general
   discussion and outline of production system model building and a case
   study in which they evaluate a model for the detailed analysis of
   customer-waitperson interactions in a restaurant setting.

AB Theories about institution-building episodes emphasize either rational
   or social and cultural elements. Our research on the Single Market
   Program (SMP) of the European Union (EU) shows that both elements are
   part of the process. When the EU was caught in a stalemate, the European
   Commission devised the SMP. The commission worked within the constraints
   of existing institutional arrangements, provided a ''cultural frame,''
   and helped create an elite social movement. This examination of the SMP
   legislation, using an institutional approach to the sociology of
   markets, shows how the commission was able to do this by trading off the
   interests of important state and corporate actors.

AB As part of a larger effort to develop an empirically grounded theory Of
   action, this article describes a previously undescribed action that
   occurs in talk-in-interaction. The practice of agreeing with another by
   repeating what they have said is shown to constitute the action of
   confirming an allusion-that is, confirming both its ''content'' and its
   prior inexplicit conveyance. The author reviews the past treatment of
   ''action'' in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an
   empirically grounded account. The account of ''confirming allusions'' is
   offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several
   instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and
   used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration
   of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is
   formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic
   techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it
   implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of
   repetition in talk-in-interaction. Tn conclusion, the significance of
   both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture
   and for sociological theory is discussed.

AB By any standard, nonrationality is an undertheorized concept in
   sociology. This paper attempts to open a discussion on nonrationality by
   analyzing one of the most fruitful theorizations of the concept:
   Simmels. Simmel developed a theory that placed nonrationality on the
   same plane with rationality and attributed to the former a role as
   fundamental as the latter's in the foundations of action, and as central
   as the latter's in the generation of existential meanings. The gradual
   eclipse of the nonrational elements of life in the expanses of a modern,
   highly rationalized world imply, then, an impoverishment of being. I
   argue that Simmel's theory of the nonrational can serve as a model
   capable of enriching our understanding of society and of the person and
   can, in this sense, serve as a counterpoint to current sociological
   theories that emphasize the rational elements of life and conceive the
   person in primarily rational terms.

   upon writings from Durkheim's later "religious" period to show how
   Durkheim has special relevance today for debates in the
   historical-comparative field. I examine how his substantive writings
   shed light on current discussions regarding civil society; how his
   analytical insights help to show how action within civil society as well
   as other historical contexts is channelled by cultural,
   social-structural, and social-psychological configurations (plus
   transformative human agency); and how his ontological commitment to a
   "relational social realisin" contributes to ongoing attempts to rethink

   to junior-level research methods classes in spring 1995. The goal in

   critical thinking and informed skepticism about questionnaire design

AB TO revisit the rural-urban contrast, we use data from nonmetropolitan

   whether, compared to personal networks in urban settings, personal
   networks in rural settings contain ties of greater intensity and role
   multiplexity, are based more on kinship and neighborhood solidarities
   rather than on friendship, are smaller, are denser, and have greater
   educational, race-ethnic, and religious homogeneity, but less age and
   gender homogeneity. Our results are generally consistent with these
   predictions. Mie then present evidence for rural diversity by comparing
   data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in southwestern
   Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing
   possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial
   communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network

AB Emile Durkheim has long been viewed as one of the founders of the

   This view ignores his considerable achievements using the methodology of
   ''case-based'' historical analysis, most prominent among them, his
   lectures on the history of French education (The Evolution of
   Educational Thought). In this paper I first outline the intimate
   relationship that Durkheim envisioned between historical and
   sociological investigation. I then turn to his work on French education
   for substantive illustrations of his approach. Finally I explore certain
   points of intersection between Durkheim's approach to history and
   present-day concerns, especially in regard to the role of culture in
   history and the opposition between prospective and retrospective
   (''teleological'') strategies of historical analysis.

   of the beginning of the theory construction movement in sociology.
   Although the formal mode of theory construction is dead now, efforts

   Specifically, if returns to the debate over functionalism as represented

   System, Change and Conflict. The paper argues that little of that
   controversy remains, but that several key issues have taken on new forms

   require a quite different title, perhaps ''Culture, Choice, and

   representations and rhetoric that residents use to make sense of their

   case study of land-use discourse in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to
   explore the ways in which imagery shapes the rhetoric available for
   land-use debate and how this, in turn, affects changes in zoning. Of
   particular importance in this process are heritage narratives. These
   broad renditions of a community's history are a form of constitutive
   rhetoric. When successful, they create an audience to whom subsequent
   appeals can be made, and they set boundaries on the content and
   direction of public discourse. The analysis suggests that communication
   and rhetorical processes are central to ecological change and that to
   dismiss these phenomena in favor of macrostructural forces is to miss a
   significant aspect of the human dimensions of local change and of the
   processes through which places are stratified.

   groups of different kinds (not only cults and communes), arguing that
   such groups are important sources of deviant behavior and are relatively
   neglected in deviance studies. Particular attention is given to
   ''deviance production groups''-groups that take in ''normal'' people and
   turn them into deviants, to some extent, such as the Branch Davidians,
   the Ku Klux Klan, and witches' covens. The course is also distinctive in
   its degree of emphasis on sociological concepts and theory, its
   complementing of other deviance courses, and its dependence on group
   discussions and presentations during class. Lectures are relatively
   infrequent; students are expected to use a study guide and to learn
   substantially from an instructor-prepared text on the deviant groups

   and economic restructuring of academia and of the larger society in
   which it is embedded. Contrary to some recent analyses, the problem lies
   more in the inadequacies of data conceptualization, production, and
   collection than in the theoretical vitality of the discipline. The
   failure to match theoretical and conceptual advances with appropriate
   data leaves sociologists grappling with ''modern data to study a
   postmodern world.'' Research on the impact of restructuring on social
   and spatial divisions of labor and the contributions of feminist theory
   and research to the conceptualization of work and household illustrate
   the theoretical advances and the empirical deficiencies faced by the
   discipline. Disciplinary survival and development depend on meeting the

   The two phenomena go hand in hand. But each needs to be understood as an
   historical construct; that is, they need to be problematized. In
   problematizing ''globalization,'' I argue that it must be understood as
   a post-developmentalist construct. The postwar goal of national
   development, institutionalized in the international Bretton Woods
   regime, has run its course-dramatized by the assault on developmentalist
   states and institutions in the monetarist regime established under the
   auspices of the 1980s debt crisis. The nationally oriented institutions
   of the developmentalist era are now being replaced by globally oriented
   institutions under the legitimizing cloak of efficiency and financial
   credibility. Related to this trend, producing communities scramble to
   reposition themselves either through finding niches in a new global
   economy or through resistance to global pressures. Either way, there is
   a new emphasis on defining the local. This article explores the
   conjunction of global and local definition.

AB Rural sociologists have been disproportionately represented among the
   major contributors to environmental sociology. In part, this is because
   several areas of longstanding rural sociological interest (e.g.,
   sociology of resource management and outdoor recreation, studies of
   resource-dependent communities) essentially came to be redefined as
   environmental sociology during the 1970s. The most significant role of
   rural sociologists in building environmental sociology, however, has
   perhaps been the fact that the material and biophysical nature of the
   phenomena they have traditionally studied contributed to a general
   predisposition to recognize the ''materiality'' of social structure and
   social life. I assess the major strategies that have been developed for
   theorizing this materiality and then indicate some of the most critical
   lines of debate and dissension. I argue that if these debates are
   examined in their specifics-rather than as incompatible perspectives or
   ''paradigms''-some opportunities for synthesis become apparent. Some
   suggested avenues of synthesis are set forth.

PD SPR 1996
PY 1996
AB Rural sociology is intrinsically concerned with the spatial dimensions
   of social life. However, this underlying research tradition,
   particularly the use of space as a research strategy, has been
   insufficiently addressed and its contributions to general sociology are
   little recognized. I outline how concern with space, uneven development,
   and the social relationships of peripheral settings have provided
   substantive boundary and conceptual meaning to rural sociology,
   propelled its evolution, and left it with a legacy of strengths,
   weaknesses, and challenges. A willingness to tackle the dimension of
   space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists
   apart fr om other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with
   general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial
   covering laws, and proto-typical relationships of modern or Fordist
   development settings. Conceptual openings have left sociologists
   questioning their past agenda. Coupled with the ''creative marginality''
   inherent in the questions and contexts addressed by rural sociologists,
   this makes tile subfield central to contemporary sociology.

   Reservations, colonias, and rural African-Americans in the South are

AB Collective violence is often social control: self-help by a group. It
   typically defines and responds to conduct as deviant. When unilateral
   and nongovernmental, it appears in four major forms-lynching, rioting,
   vigilantism, and terrorism-each distinguished by its system of liability
   (individual or collective) and degree of organization (higher or lower).
   Following Donald Black's paradigm of pure sociology, the central
   assumption is that collective violence varies with its location and
   direction in social space-the conflict structure. I offer ten
   propositions that predict and explain the likelihood and severity of
   collective violence in general and the four forms of collective violence
   in particular Conflict structures with a high degree of relational
   distance, cultural distance, functional independence, and inequality
   between the adversaries are associated with collective violence in
   general. Each of the four forms depends on the degree of social
   polarization between the parties as well as the continuity of the
   deviant behavior to which the violence responds.

AB Most sociological research designs assume that each person has one sex,
   one sexuality, and one gender, congruent with each other and fixed for
   life. Postmodern feminists and queer theorists have been interrogating
   bodies, desires, and genders, but sociology has not. Deconstructing sex,
   sexuality and gender reveals many possible categories embedded in social
   experiences and social practices. As researchers, as theorists, and as
   activists, sociologists have to go beyond paying lip service to the
   diversity of bodies, sexualities, genders. The sociologist's task should
   be to deconstruct the conventional categories of sex, sexuality, and
   gender and build new complex, cross-cubing constructs into research
   designs. There are revolutionary possibilities inherent in rethinking
   the categories of gender, sexuality and physiological sex. Sociological
   data that challenge conventional knowledge by reframing the questions
   could provide legitimacy for new ways of thinking. Data that undermine
   the supposed natural dichotomies on which the social orders of most
   modem societies are still based could radically alter political
   discourses that valorize biological causes, essential heterosexuality,
   and traditional gender roles in families and workplaces.

AB Although widely recognized as one of sociology's true classics, Max
   Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism has largely
   failed to influence the development of sociological theory in the United
   States. Because it has been read almost exclusively as a study of the
   "role of ideas" in economic development, its diverse and multifaceted
   theoretical contributions generally have been neglected. This study
   explicitly calls attention to The Protestant Ethic as a theoretical
   treatise by examining this classic in reference to four major debates in
   postwar sociological theory in the United States. Moreover, it
   demarcates an array of major parameters in American theorizing. The
   conclusion speculates upon the reasons for the strong opposition to The
   Protestant Ethic's theoretical lessons and argues that a style of
   theorizing unique to sociology in the United States has erected firm
   barriers against this classic text.

   frame-work for the 292 articles and research commentaries published from
   1986 to 1995. While particular topics ebb and flow in terms of their
   importance, there continues to be a consistent focus on the substantive
   issues of traditional concern. Predictions in 1985 as to what the next
   retrospective would show proved to be fairly accurate. Applied empirical
   and quantitative studies continue to dominate the pages of the journal,
   but other types (e.g., qualitative and historical studies) now appear
   with greater frequency. The theoretical foundation of rural sociology
   has been enriched with conceptual frameworks from general sociology and
   other social sciences. New twists on the traditional concerns of
   agricultural constituencies and rural community leaders have broadened
   the range of topics addressed, reflecting the major social structures,
   processes, and issues currently affecting rural peoples and communities.
   The article concludes with an interpretation of recent trends and

AB The traditional positivist model is an inadequate foundation for

   Agency, the ability to choose among alternatives where the choice makes
   an important difference, exists in social phenomena but has no
   counterpart in nature and cannot be dealt with adequately by positivism.
   A technological science perspective is suggested as an alternative for a
   science of sociology that can deal with the reality and importance of
   agency. Eight differences between the traditional perspective and the
   alternative are sketched. The alternative requires changes in the kind
   of generalized knowledge produced and the way it is produced,
   accumulated, and refined. The changes, though seemingly small, would
   produce a major reconstruction of much of sociology; such changes could
   result in important progress by the field of sociology.

AB Warner and England (1995) make a welcome argument for a technological

   As with any sociological perspective, however, Warner and England's
   comments help to focus on and understand some aspects of social life and
   not others. This commentary provides a complementary focus by
   emphasizing the dialectical relationship between human agency and
   technological agency. Furthermore, I argue that a dialectical view is
   necessary for grounding Warner and England's theoretical argument and
   for acting on their ethical argument. Implications of a dialectical
   perspective for the meaning and politics of technology are explored. The

AB Bell's (1995) critique of our discussion of a technological science
   perspective for sociology is a helpful effort to maintain a balance
   between our emphasis on agency and creativity and on the constraining
   side of society. We emphasize agency as part of a dialectic between
   human effort and societal resistance for three reasons. First, it forces
   reconceptualization of the nature of the science of sociology by
   shifting from a positivist mode to one that is pragmatic. The meaning of
   scientific findings changes. Second, agency has been ignored
   historically while constraint has been overemphasized. We seek to
   establish a balance by reentering the notion of agency into sociological
   discourse. Third, agency is a mechanism for modifying constraints and
   solving the problems associated with social technologies. In the closing
   paragraphs of the reply, we suggest that the view under discussion be
   seen as an ethical pragmatism. Agency forces us to ethical questions and
   a pragmatic understanding of science.

AB Sociology of ''primitive societies'' has revised its earlier views about
   ''kinship,'' lineage, or lineage mode of production. It attempts now to
   show that lineage did not pervade African precolonial societies and that
   other relations, such as capitalist and class relations, were also
   present. This article seeks to reestablish, contrary to the revisionist
   view, the centrality of lineage in African precolonial societies to
   allow for a paradigmatic shift that repudiates evolutionism and brings
   precolonial societies back to the center of the African debate. Because
   in such a reoriented debate Africa ceases to be marginalized and on the
   fringes of other historical experiences, the shift allows,
   paradoxically, the integration of scholarship on Africa into universal
   social theory.

AB This paper offers an analysis of the continuing crisis in sociology that
   is different from those that have appeared in the literature. In
   contrast to the ideological and technical readings, it suggests that the
   origins of the crisis are to be found in the hermeneutic challenge that
   has resulted from the linguistic and multicultural turns. Both of these
   developments have given rise to new discourses within the academy that
   are competing with subfields such as the sociology of the arts and
   race/ethnic relations. The nature and impact of this new competition is
   examined in greater detail through the case of the sociology of race.
   The analysis reveals that these competitive challenges are hermeneutic
   in nature and not primarily technical or ideological. The paper
   concludes with some suggestions for crisis resolution.

AB The use of computer simulation experiments as a tool for working with
   theories is not as widespread in sociology as it is in most scientific
   disciplines. This brief articles explains how modeling is a distinctive
   activity from either ''theory'' or ''empirical analysis'' but how it
   informs both and connects them. Simulation models are artificial objects
   created to translate theoretical generalizations into specific scenarios
   involving states (variables and/or actors) and rates (the dynamic causal
   laws hypothesized to generate change over time in the states).
   Simulation models are analyzed to understand the full range of
   implications of theoretical statements as they apply to producing
   historical realizations under particular circumstances. Simulation
   analysis operates by a method of experimentation, unlike mathematical
   modeling and statistical modeling. The strengths and limitations of
   these three approaches to studying models are discussed and suggested to
   be complementary rather than competitive with each other. Last, this
   article briefly points out some of the unique features of the exemplars
   that compose the remainder of this special issue of Sociological

   including tensions resulting from the introduction of gender as a

   dichotomous categories that define sociology's boundaries and identity,
   it also displaces the discipline's central problematic of modernity. The

   the relevance of feminist theoretical work to contemporary issues in

AB The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the ''political culture
   concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly Habermas's account of the
   Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original
   political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory
   in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture
   is used in a way that is neither political nov cultural. Explaining this
   peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its
   companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number
   2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself
   is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here
   called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual
   relationships that combine into Angle-American citizenship theory. The
   method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to
   analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and
   dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in
   cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative,
   and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical
   findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called
   the Angle-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an
   epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a
   metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in
   political sociology.

AB Formal socialization of graduate students into the profession is not

   any sort for graduate students. In the past 20 years, however, concern
   for teaching excellence has increased, as has evidence of the
   effectiveness of teacher training. This study examines survey responses
   from 218 U.S. and Canadian sociology departments on the nature of
   teacher training for today's graduate students. Only about half of the
   teaching assistants and graduate students teaching their own courses
   receive formal training, an indication of little change in the
   institutional profile of training programs. We argue that the lack of
   formal socialization into the teacher role, especially compared with
   comprehensive training offered in research methods, contributes to the
   devaluation of teaching among sociologists.

AB Many sociologists seek to develop students' ''sociological

   two different but related purposes, one pedagogical and the other
   empirical. First, we try to create some unity about what sociologists
   mean by ''the sociological imagination,'' and how they implement this
   concept. We argue that sociologists, like academics in other
   disciplines, fry to speak in a certain ''voice'' which provides a unique
   analytical framework but is distinct from the jargon of the discipline.
   Our second, empirical goal is to assess why students do or do not learn
   the ''voice'' of sociology. We found that certain background
   characteristics df students hinder or help the development of this
   voice. In addition, contradictory, confusing, and competing
   pedagogies-both within sociology and across disciplines-impede the
   development of the sociological imagination.

   Method and evidence, not subject matter, distinguish articles from

   public universities are more likely to publish articles. Gender and rank
   are associated with choice of genre, while citation rates increase with

AB A meaningful interpretation of the dynamics of recent momentous
   historical changes - most notably the unexpected and surprising
   implosion of the Soviet empire in 1989-1990 - may be obtained by
   recombining aspects of the sociology of religion analyses of Weber and
   Durkheim. In particular, their complementary notions of 'charisma' and
   'collective effervescence' provide an understanding of how social actors
   in coercive secular states, confronted by a seeming monopoly of the use
   of physical force, are able, in certain exceptional circumstances, to
   mobilise and disarm the state. The assembling of the societal or
   national community is the background to Weber's discussion of
   charismatic leadership and the foreground to Durkheim. The 'velvet
   revolutions' of 1989 in various countries of Eastern Europe may be seen
   as manifestations of an historical moment of 'collective effervescence'
   in which the assembled collectivity itself, more than individual
   figures, manifested the empowerment of charisma.

AB One of the most difficult environmental policy challenges facing the
   United States and other societies is that of finding ways to safely
   dispose of hazardous and toxic substances, including nuclear waste
   materials. Efforts to site such facilities have been uniformly
   unsuccessful, due largely to strong public opposition. Although
   supporters of such facilities often emphasize the potential for local
   economic development and other opportunities, opponents focus on a
   variety of threats involving potential risks associated with waste
   disposal. Survey data collected in rural areas of Nevada and Nebraska
   where nuclear waste disposal facilities have been proposed reveal that
   respondents' positions on issues of perceived health and safety risks,
   trust in responsible agencies, anticipated local economic effects, and
   concerns about environmental contamination are key variables predicting
   local response. Even in areas where there may be substantial local
   support for economic opportunities associated with the facilities,
   broad-based fears about nuclear materials and a legacy of distrust in
   the agencies responsible for managing nuclear wastes suggest that
   proposals for such facilities will almost inevitably continue to
   generate strong public opposition.

AB Sociological efforts to understand environment-society relationships
   fall primarily into four conceptual categories. The first three,
   involving analytical separation, analytical primacy, and balanced
   dualism, all draw distinctions between biophysical and social aspects of
   human experience, with subsequent analyses being based on these a priori
   distinctions. The fourth or constructivist approach questions this
   naturalized dichotomy, calling attention instead to mutual contingency
   or conjoint constitution: What we take to be ''physical facts'' are
   likely to be strongly shaped by social construction processes, and at
   the same time, what we take to be ''strictly social'' will often have
   been shaped in part by taken-for-granted realities of the physical
   world. Technology offers important opportunities for tracing these
   interconnections, being an embodiment of both the physical and the
   social. The point is illustrated with a long-term historical analysis of
   a specific physiographic feature-a mountain-that has undergone little
   overt physical change over the centuries, but has undergone repeated
   changes in its social meanings and uses. Few of the changes would have
   been possible in the absence of the mountain's physiographic
   characteristics; similarly, few would have occurred in the absence of
   changing sociocultural definitions and possibilities. The challenge for
   sociology is not just to recognize the importance of both the physical
   and the social factors, and certainly not to argue over the relative
   importance of the two, but to recognize the extent to which what we rake
   to be ''physical'' and ''social'' factors can be conjointly constituted.

   orientation. What is to replace them is less clear. This paper argues
   that progress and cumulation can be seen as a process of evaluation and
   retention within an epistemic community. Scholarly disciplines differ in
   their social structure and in their epistemic and normative commitments.
   Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation
   differ within its multiple subdisciplines, which to varying extents
   represent epistemic communities. Brief sketches of progress (advance)

   consistent with the pattern first suggested by Lotka. Publication in top
   journals is a relatively open process with a large number of different
   authors publishing over a 20-year period and considerable circulation of
   top publishing authors in adjacent decades. Top publishers and ASA
   presidents appear to follow different career paths. ASA presidents tend

AB Recently some mainstream sociologists have renewed their efforts to
   discard the traditional Marxist concepts of class structure, class
   contradictions, and class struggle as outmoded and unimportant
   components of social analysis. In contrast, this article argues in favor
   of the continuing relevance of these concepts and of Marxist class
   analysis in general in line with economic decline and increasing class
   polarization in the United States. Applying Marxist class analysis to
   the study of the advanced capitalist class structure and its
   contradictions, this article emphasizes the pivotal role of the Marxist
   approach in sociology in analyzing the dynamics of contemporary
   capitalist society.

AB The historical development of sociology is outlined, from (1) close ties
   with social reform in the early 20th century, to (2) the divorce of
   sociology from social reform in the 1930s through the 1960s, when the
   ''pure science'' model dominated, to (3) the domination of the
   ''unmasking inequality'' model since the 1970s. I argue for a ''reducing
   inequality'' model. A content analysis of articles on inequality in
   three leading journals shows a shift in the 1970s to a structuralist
   perspective linked to unmasking inequality. But research that unmasks
   inequality still ignores social reform because career advancement
   depends on following the pure science model. Case studies of 12
   sociologists illustrate strategies for combining research with social
   betterment.

   as undesirable areas of overcrowding and social pathology. Regarded as
   either transitional districts or obstacles to modernization, ethnic
   places were subject to slum clearance during the modernist phase of
   urban development. Ethnic places have acquired a new historical and
   sentimental salience in the ''postmodern'' developmental era.
   Preservationist activists and minority ''place entrepreneurs'' project
   ethnic culture and symbolic representations in defensive or proactive
   ways to stimulate neighborhood revitalization. These trends are evident
   in the recent urban developmental history of Houston, Texas.

AB Serious chronic illness undermines the unity between body and self and
   forces identity changes. To explicate how the body, identity, and self
   intersect in illness, one mode of living with impairment, adapting, is
   explicated in this article. Adapting means altering life and self to
   accommodate to bodily losses and limits and resolving the lost unity
   between body and self It means struggling with rather than against
   illness. The process of adapting consists of three major stages: (1)
   experiencing and defining impairment, (2) making bodily assessments and,
   subsequently, identity trade-offs, as ill people weigh their losses and
   gains and revise their identity goals, and (3) surrendering to the sick
   self by relinquishing control over illness and by flowing with the
   experience of it. Adapting seldom occurs only once. Rather chronically
   ill people are forced to adapt repeatedly as they experience new losses.
   The data consist of 115 interviews about experiencing chronic illness
   and 25 more focused interviews about the body in chronic illness. The
   strategies of grounded theory provided the methods for completing the
   analysis.

AB This article reexamines the stigma of physical disability using the
   empirical example of wheelchair users' treatment in public places. It
   draws upon conversational interviews with wheelchair users, field notes
   recorded during participant observation in public places while using
   wheelchairs, and previously published autobiographical accounts. The
   analysis of these materials primarily focuses upon the many public
   encounters in which wheelchair users request and receive various forms
   of assistance. Our analysis demonstrates that wheelchair users' place in
   public life is more uncertain and unsettled than the concepts deviance
   and stigma suggest. We argue for an empirical reassessment of the social
   definition of various physical disabilities through ethnographic study
   of relations between typical and atypical people and analytic attention
   to situated processes of identification.

AB Previous studies of stratification in science have found a consistent
   positive correlation between the prestige of the departments where
   scientists received their degrees and the prestige of the departments
   where they obtained jobs, especially their first jobs. This correlation
   held regardless of previous research performance. Two limitations
   associated with these studies are (1) their almost exclusive focus on
   the hard sciences, and (2) their inability to inform a theoretical
   comparison between the hard and soft sciences. This study uses data on
   new sociology Ph.D.s who obtained their first job in Ph.D.-granting
   departments between 1985 and 1992 in order to assess whether the
   stratifying mechanisms in the hiring of sociologists are similar to
   those in the hard sciences. The results are generally consistent with
   previous findings for the hard sciences and suggest that job placement
   in sociology values academic origins over performance. The two strongest
   determinants of the prestige of a first job are the prestige of the
   Ph.D.-granting department and the selectivity of the undergraduate
   institution. In contrast, the effects of predoctorate single- or
   first-authored publications and of mentor's recognition are weak, though
   significant.

AB I explore a set of contradictions crucial to Durkheim's work, that
   revolve around the issue of whether modern society (i.e., industrial
   capitalism) is structured according to the principle of individual
   mobility or the principle of caste. Specifically, I analyze Durkheim's
   theories of race, class, and sex to determine if they describe modern
   society in terms of individuals or in terms of castes. I find that
   Durkheim has both a dominant and a subordinate theory for each category.
   I also find that his theories of race and class differ significantly
   from his theories of sex. Durkheim's dominant theories of race and class
   and his subordinate theory of sex are theories of individuals in modern
   society. Conversely, his dominant theory of sex and his subordinate
   theories of race and class are theories of castes in modern society. I
   view Durkheim's social theory as a quintessential construction of
   modernity, and I view Durkheim as a quintessential liberal ''of sorts.''
   I conclude that the contradictions at the heart of Durkheim's social
   theory are contradictions at the heart of modern society-and at the
   heart of liberal ideology.

AB Persistent fiscal constraints in higher education pose special risks for
   sociology. The organization of academia gives all departments problems
   in self-governance. But these problems are intensified for sociology by
   features that can be sources of both strength and weakness (e.g., an
   affinity for students with agendas of reform and radical criticism) and
   that tend to attract critical attention from administrators and make it
   hard for sociologists to agree how to respond to external threats. The
   expansion of the American Sociological Association's activities beyond
   its original focus exacerbates the difficulties of dealing with
   disciplinary issues and reaching consensual strategies to confront them.

AB The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with a recent trend toward the revival of
   the ''political culture concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly,
   Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in
   common with the original political culture concept associated with
   Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases,
   the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither
   political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central
   problem addressed in this article and one to follow I hypothesize that
   this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an
   historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual
   network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into
   Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology
   of concept formation is introduced to analyze historically and
   empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual
   network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and
   sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional
   analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual
   network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American
   citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of
   social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that
   continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.

   students in 16 graduate programs in sociology.  Using Rosenbaum's

   of social psychological integration, this study examines students'
   access to initial funding, resources in the department, indicators of
   prior ability, current professional activities, mentoring processes, and
   social psychological factors for their effects on socialization into the
   academic profession.  Access to initial funding and to mentoring have
   substantial effects on PhD students' professional socialization, but
   prove to be less than rational processes in the graduate program.  This
   socialization process is found to be based more on particularistic than
   on universalistic criteria in the allocation of departmental resources
   and mentoring.  Implications for graduate student mentoring, funding,
   and divergent career paths are highlighted.

AB This paper examines the schorlary content of four widely adopted

   material to support their positions, we found substantial differences in
   the sources selected as noteworthy, including a heavy reliance on
   nonacademic sources such as newspapers and weekly magazines.  The use of
   popular sources was associated with the author's scholarly publication
   records:  stronger records coincided with a more scientifically grounded
   presentation of the discipline.  Despite the limitations of the standard
   introductory textbook, we view it as the best way to convey the content
   of sociology.  Also, because most students probably base their
   perceptions of sociology on the introductory course, the textbook plays
   a pivotal role:  how source materials are used to present sociology in
   introductory textbooks may affect students' perceptions about the
   utility of the discipline.

AB Sociology was founded in the nineteenth century as a discipline for the

   has been attacked by both liberals and conservatives.  The attacks have
   left the discipline vulnerable both inside and outside academia.  This
   paper argues that other sciences have faced similar problems.  By
   following their example and by teaching sociology courses as laboratory
   sciences, we are most likely to legitimate the knowledge of the
   discipline and overcome public and student skepticism.  Improvements in
   computer software offer a growing number of laboratory options for
   classroom use, including surveys of students, which permit scientific
   demonstrations of social facts.  Although such surveys are not new to
   the discipline, they should be used more frequently to overcome
   students' skepticism and to motivate students to pursue independent
   social investigations.

   to enhance our understanding of both economy and society. Economics has
   had a greater influence on sociology than vice versa: several core
   subfields of sociology - such as labor market sociology, stratification,
   and work and organizations - have been significantly influenced by
   economic theories; but sociology has had relatively little impact on
   economics. Communication between economics and sociology is hindered by
   intellectual barriers such as fundamentally different assumptions with
   regard to the roles of induction and deduction, as well as by
   institutional and professional obstacles. Opportunities are growing for
   integrating sociological and economic explanations, as the interests of
   sociologists and economists are converging and more work is now
   occurring on the border between the two disciplines.

AB This article maps out some interdependencies between political science
   and political sociology. It then details some lessons that political
   sociologists might take from four contemporary literatures in political
   science: (1) rational choice work on rational individual action in
   institutional context; (2) the ''nonlinear social systems'' literature
   on the contextual determination of intensely embedded social actions;
   (3) the game-theoretic literature on strategic interactions among large
   emergent class and state actors; and (4) a more qualitative inductive,
   and contextualized approach to the analysis of class and state action
   extending the tradition of Barrington Moore. The four literatures share
   a commitment to social action that is decreasingly common among
   sociologists. Yet they address questions of institutional constraint,
   contextual dynamics, and macrosocial history akin to those that are
   engaging their sociological contemporaries. This balance of attention
   between action and its constraints is the common element drawn from the
   several instructive political science literatures.

AB In the area of social psychology, sociologists have drawn more
   frequently from psychologists than the reverse. This is in part because
   sociologists more often assess the degree to which status
   characteristics, social relationships, and structural contexts influence
   individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, while psychologists more
   often explicate the mechanisms through which such social factors affect
   individuals. I illustrate these differences by discussing points of
   parallel theoretical development between the two disciplines,
   substantive divisions of labor, and selected topics of mutual inquiry.
   Although sociologists benefit substantially from psychologists' work,
   sociologists could offer their counterparts more pointed demonstrations
   that sociological mechanisms are crucial for explaining key
   psychological phenomena and that structural contexts constrain
   individuals' behaviors in ways often overlooked by psychologists.

   and answer questions of perennial importance to social theory. I draw on
   recent research and literature both in sociology and in history to argue
   that we should and can continue to deepen the discipline's ''historical

AB We argue that sociology should be the integrative discipline for the
   scientific study of religion. Sociology has made considerable progress
   by incorporating specialized knowledge of religion from disciplines
   ranging from gerontology and community psychology to religious
   economics, church history, and even theology. Sociology has also
   generated insights in other disciplines concerned with the study of
   religion, at times shaping the types of questions asked, the concepts
   and research methods employed, and the conclusions reached in these
   fields. To elaborate our arguments, iue focus on two important
   substantive areas: (1) research on the relationships between religion,
   meaning systems, and personal well-being; and (2) research on religious
   behavior and religious markets. We underscore the integrative role of
   sociology, and identify several neglected opportunities for synthesis.
   In addition, briefly assess the effect of sociology on work in other
   disciplines and on the functioning of religious organizations.

AB Biological causes of human social behavior will be invisible to those
   who follow the Durkheimian injunction to seek the causes of social facts
   in preceding social facts. Sociologists ignore or deny these biological
   causes at peril of grievous error. Biological causes can be integrated
   with traditional sociological models, but this approach will require
   sociologists to incorporate into their thinking the knowledge of
   disciplines whose paradigms offer biological explanations of the
   behaviors important to sociologists. I take examples of such knowledge
   from evolutionary biology, behavior genetics, and behavioral
   endocrinology.

AB This study explores contemporary regional variations in African American
   religious life. Building on a rich tradition of historical and
   ethnographic research on the Black church, we contrast the religious
   environments that have traditionally prevailed in the Black communities
   of the rural South and urban non-South. We emphasize regional variations
   in (1) the social role of religious institutions, (2) the availability
   of alternative lifestyles and secular opportunities for status and
   resources, and (3) the social norms and community expectations regarding
   church involvement A series of hypotheses regarding patterns and
   correlates of church participation are then tested, using data from the
   National Survey of Black Americans. Findings indicate that historical
   regional variations in African American religious life persist in the
   contemporary period. Moreover, our results suggest that the rural
   southern Black church retains ifs traditional ''semi-involuntary''
   character and we discuss the broader theoretical implications of this
   issue for future research in the sociology of religion.

AB In response to editor Stephen Cole's question-''What's wrong with
   sociology?''-the answer is nothing that cannot be overcome by clearer
   communications and better public relations.  The problem is that the
   field is not held in high esteem by college administrators, legislators,
   and the public.  Many see us as rebels of the 1960s, political liberals,
   and impractical thinkers with a penchant for jargon.  Even our research
   is derided by some as a waste of money.  The solution consists of
   strategies for overcoming our poor public image.  Seven strategies for
   doing so are discussed:  (1) Write clearly.  (2) Write for a mass
   audience.  (3) Seek board positions.  (4) Strengthen our identity.  (5)
   Teach sociology in high school.  (6) Develop academic partnerships.  (7)
   Emphasize outcomes:  increase in tolerance and research skills.

AB The theory of demographic transition served as the principal descriptive
   tool for fertility change in developing nations for more than 30 years.
   Weaknesses of the theory as both a descriptive and an explanatory
   framework have led largely to its rejection. While a number of
   alternative frameworks have been suggested, none has received the
   widespread support once accorded transition theory. This analysis
   reviews transition theory and argues for the theoretical importance of
   institutional factors in fertility decline. Sub-Saharan Africa serves as
   the locus of the analysis because it remains the world region with the
   highest fertility and the one in which the transition is just beginning.
   The organization of agricultural production is hypothesized to be
   important for fertility behavior and is identified as one of three
   institutional areas in which rural sociology may be uniquely qualified
   to contribute.

   to social distance, the author provides an extension of the aspects of
   territorialization to the entire globe.  A global sociology requires a
   reactivation and global application of two nearly forgotten
   subdisciplines:  sphragistics, that is, the discipline that investigates
   ideas and practices related to the use of seals and signet rings; and
   ekistics, that is, the scientific study of human settlements.  Among the
   subconcepts that are elaborated in service to these developments are
   home territorialization, boundaried communication, and the
   territorialization of the body politic.  Examples are drawn from
   post-cold war developments in Eastern Europe.

AB Schumpeter's writings on the transition from capitalism to socialism, on
   innovative entrepreneurship, on business cycles, and on the modern
   corporation have attracted muck attention among social scientists.
   Although Schumpeter's theoretical and sociological writings resemble the
   works of Marx, Durkheim and Weber in that they further our understanding
   of the rise and nature of modern society, his contribution to social
   theory has yet to be assessed systematically, Arguing that Schumpeter's
   perspective, if understood in social theoretical terms, provides a
   promising starting point for the sociological analysis of the changing
   relationship between economy and society, I concentrate on two elements
   of his work that are of value to theoretical sociology today: the
   distinction between creative action and rational action that is
   fundamental to his theory of the entrepreneur and his thesis that the
   success of the capitalist system leads to its demise.

AB This paper argues the case for a renewed interest in Schutz's work by
   extending his theory of the conscious subject to the feminist concern
   with the issue of domination. We present a theoretical analysis of the
   subjective and intersubjective experiences of individuals relating to
   each other as dominant and subordinate; as our theoretical point of
   departure we use Schutz's concepts of the we-relation, the assumption of
   reciprocity of perspectives, typification, working,
   taken-for-grantedness, and relevance. Schutz's sociology of the
   conscious subject is striking in its lack of any extended consideration
   of power; perhaps one reason why support for his work has diminished
   since the mid-1970s. Our overlayering of feminist sociological theory's
   interest in domination with Schutz's concerns about subjectivity and
   intersubjectivity produces an elaboration and a critique of Schutz and
   expands feminist understanding of relationships of domination.

PD 1995
PY 1995
AB There is increasing sociological interest in formal models of action
   driven by a calculus of expected utility. We believe these efforts to
   extend microeconomic models to extraeconomic exchange can benefit from
   specification of societal constraints on individual choice. One type of
   constraint locates the actor in an evolving network of social ties that
   limit opportunities for exchange. Another approach assumes that choices
   are influenced by unintended outcomes that operate behind the backs of
   the actors. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years
   incorporating social structure and unintended consequences into formal
   models based on individual choice optimization. We critically examine
   leading contributions to network exchange theory (part 1) and
   evolutionary models of collective action (part 2), and assess how these
   and related developments may shape the future of rational choice theory
   and its place within sociology.

   positive developments and problems experienced by departments and the
   discipline in general. Issues examined include student enrollment and
   degree recipients over the last two decades, enrollment trends in other
   disciplines, recent trends in advertised sociology faculty positions,
   the status of women and minorities, and which departments have and have
   not been eliminated. Based upon this assessment and the growing
   literature in the field dealing with these issues, future prospects for
   departments are discussed, problem areas are identified, and
   recommendations are made concerning the strengthening of the profession.
   While recognizing the challenges faced by sociology, this appraisal
   suggests that negative perceptions within the discipline concerning
   these difficulties can become exaggerated. Attention is directed to
   several issues affecting the status of sociology, including the effects
   of a ''rhetoric of despair.''

   of sociology as a multiparadigm discipline is both an effect and a
   source of this lack of self-definition. Some of the roots of the present
   crisis are traced to the acceptance of outside values, ideological and
   otherwise, as a means of specifying what is and is not sociologically
   appropriate. As this occurs, we become more and more an adjunct of other
   intellectual and policy-oriented projects, becoming less and less a

AB In Goffman's introduction to Interaction Ritual, he implores
   sociologists ''to identify the countless patterns and natural sequences
   of behavior occurring whenever persons come into one another's immediate
   presence.''  This article, in addressing Goffman's entreaty, amalgamates
   a number of sociological theories on interaction ritual from Durkheim
   and Goffman with others in contemporary literatures in the sociology of
   emotions and social psychology to describe a set of ''patterns and
   natural sequences of behavior'' imbedded in voices of interaction
   partners.  These patterns are shown to establish an element of social
   structure, and this research describes an objective method of
   identifying and measuring this element that previously was known on a
   qualitative basis alone.  A social status ordering pattern founded upon
   interpersonal deference and power relations is identified through
   analysis of acoustic energy levels in voices of interview partners. 
   Nonverbal measures are performed using a dual-channel Fast Fourier
   Transform analyzer and results are explained using a carrier spectrum
   model.  This report sets forth an interesting new way of objectively
   measuring the macro social constraints on micro interaction.

   reflected on how best to characterize Gilbreth's management of women, I
   began to see that my notion of how to write critical, historical
   biography rested heavily on a binary, modernist conceptual foundation.
   My research experience rocked this foundation by convincing me that we
   should see selves as multiple and interests as malleable, and that we
   should broaden our conception of power to include disciplinary power
   which circulates through people rather than belonging to them. The paper
   concludes by affirming the merits of new ways of writing about people

   strength of modernist language.

AB We formulate a comprehensive theory that accounts for variation in the
   perception of time. According to our theory, lived time is perceived to
   pass slowly (protracted duration) when conscious information processing
   is high; lived time is perceived to be synchronized with clock time
   (synchronicity) when conscious information processing is moderate; and
   lived time is perceived to have passed quickly (temporal compression)
   when conscious information processing is low. We examine that portion of
   the theory concerning temporal compression in light of empirical
   materials. Since episodic memory erodes as time passes, we hypothesize
   that this generates the experience of temporal compression by lowering
   the density of conscious information processing. Our data were drawn
   from three different age cohorts, and we find strong support for the
   hypothesis.

AB The social philosophy of meaning and emotions represented in the work of
   Susanne Langer was recognized by Talcott Parsons, but has yet to be
   incorporated into mainstream sociological theoritizations.  Langer's
   work is as potentially important to contemporary microsociology, and the
   sociology of emotions, as the work of Peirce, Mead, or Schutz.  The
   impediment to appreciating her work resides in contemporary confusions
   regarding the nature of logic.  Sociologists often subscribe to
   Wittgenstein's denial of the validity of formal logic in constructing
   theories of human behavior.  Langer has been misunderstood because her
   theoretizations address more than discursive logics and meanings.  The
   thrust of Langer's work is that logic and meaning exist on a
   nondiscursive level of emotions.  Though her work is more than 50 years
   old, we are now in a position to appreciate it because we are now
   exploring and conceptualizing the notion of social inferencing as
   existing beyond formal logic.

AB Recent research has revealed that war-making has played an important
   role in molding society and has precipitated a new look at
   state-building, the relationship between the state and society, and the
   ties between war-making and capitalism. In this study, I illuminate
   weaknesses in the received view of regional processes, and I demonstrate
   the value of bringing the state into analyses of regional
   transformation. Case studies of the steel industry, airframe
   manufacturers, and military installations contrast pre- and postwar
   trends to determine if the state's World War II investments transformed
   regional processes or if wartime investments merely reinforced processes
   that were already underway. For the steel industry, the
   civilian-oriented and economistic reasoning of the received view of
   regional processes is most persuasive. In contrast, the state's wartime
   logistic and strategic priorities molded the dramatic expansion of U.S.
   military bases during the war-growth machine politics played an
   important secondary role. The airframe industry offers the most
   interesting case-the economic influences on this industry intersected
   with both military and political factors. Thus, this study provides
   evidence that regional processes are molded by the overlapping, and at
   times competing, needs for use of space by economic, political, and
   military actors. The immediate lesson is that it is important to bring
   the study of war-making into the sociological mainstream.

AB In a thought-provoking appraisal of the state of macrosociological
   theory, Gerhard Lenski argues that its shortcomings can be rectified, in
   part, by reference to nomological reasoning. Moreover, developments in
   behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics offer
   interesting insights into analyses of social behavior across time and
   space and, in the process, reveal some useful hints about the manner in
   which sociocultural theorists might proceed in developing more elegant
   theoretical statements. With these considerations in mind, the argument
   elaborated in this essay suggests: (1) that contemporary sociocultural
   science has much to contribute to the development of a general theory of
   social behavior; (2) that theory refinement in the sociocultural
   sciences can be enhanced significantly by reference to general
   principles (specifically, an amended version of the ''maximization
   principle'') developed in recent years in the evolutionary behavioral
   sciences; and (3) that reliance on such general analytical principles is
   enormously helpful in clarifying some seemingly troublesome theoretical
   problems in, for example, studies of social demography and human ecology
   and of social stratification and mobility.

AB Outside of sociology, evolutionary theory is once again commanding

   unaware that the field has prospered and is now a respected,
   interdisciplinary science with a growing number of influential scholars
   within the social sciences. This article takes a critical look at
   sociobiology with a consideration of both its historical origins and its
   now modified theoretical stance, which is exemplified by Timothy
   Crippen's article 'Toward a Neo-Darwinian Sociology.'' In addition, this
   essay summarizes an alternative approach that might be called
   ''evolutionary sociology. '' While it also incorporates the Modem
   Synthesis, it uses established sociological methods and theory, along
   with primate data and the fossil and archaeological records, to consider
   the biological legacy of humankind.

   genuinely evolutionary approaches is expressed, to varying degrees, in
   the reactions of Freese and Maryanski to my essay on neo-Darwinian
   sociology. In this brief response to their comments, I suggest that
   these general reservations are grounded in an unnecessary fear of
   resurgent Social Darwinism, unwarranted concerns regarding determinism
   and reductionism, unjustified allegations of teleology and tautology,
   and/or general misconceptions of the logic and principles of
   neo-Darwinian theory.

AB The article begins by underscoring the widely noted ''sociological
   crisis'' and the message from the history of science that the crisis may
   be susceptible to resolution through an application of a general law
   pertaining to a neighboring science (sociobiology in our case). From
   here, the article proceeds to pinpoint the basic argument of Professor
   Crippen's article (this issue) and then critically examines the two
   articles that critically accompany it. We find some errors of
   interpretation in Professor Maryanski's article, but on the whole it is
   a constructive critique of Crippen's essay and a related invitation to a
   biologically informed evolutionary sociology. By contrast, Professor
   Freese's interminable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and
   in the process offers a tortuous, tendentious itinerary of politically
   correct interpretations of scientific inquiry in general and
   sociobiological science in particular.

AB Historical sociologists have been property critical of the tendency
   within the social sciences to ignore temporality and, consequently,
   historical contingency in social processes. These critical assessments
   have generated alternative formal research methods that either (a)
   continue to use variable-centered procedures but allow relations between
   variables to change through time, or (b) abandon variable-centered
   procedures altogether and move exclusively to event-centered analyses.
   After considering alternative conceptions of historically contingent
   determination that may be produced by two different formal methods
   (time-varying parameter regression and event structure analysis), the
   authors design a combined strategy that temporally nests interdependent
   forms of contingency and illustrates the approach in an empirical
   analysis of the  ''relief explosion'' in the late 1960s. Contrary to
   exhortations for exclusivist strategies, the results suggest that
   variable-centered and event-centered methods can be fruitfully combined
   In particular event structure analysis is shown to be a useful
   qualitative procedure for ''unpacking'' and interpreting quantitative
   turning points in time-varying parameter time series models. This
   strategy allows macroquantitative and historical/cultural processes to
   be integrated with formal methods.

AB Why has W.E.B. Du Bois not mattered more in sociology?  In addition to
   being on the short list of the 20th century's most influential public

   intellectual contributions as a sociologist and social theorist.  Among
   his nearly 2000 published writings, The Philadelphia Negro and Souls of
   Black Folk have all the qualities of classic works.  Yet, neither has
   been officially canonized by sociology.  The exclusion of Du Bois can be
   explained with tolerable plausibility by reference to his two key
   concepts in Souls of Black Folk:  the veil and the double-self.  One can
   only wonder what might have been significantly different about
   sociology, especially its theories of the Self and of field studies of
   race, had William James's most important student been allowed to matter.

   reveals a political program for reform of the ancient regime.  This
   reform is founded on a reform of domestic mores.  Rousseau's attendant
   conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more
   unified than that found in modern sociology.  Rousseau shows that the

AB Social scientists have begun to appreciate the importance of style in
   academic discourse.  Style and its evaluation, I argue, are not givens,
   but are created and negotiated by a body of readers, judging a text.  To
   explain the process by which style comes to be known, I choose the case
   of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in
   1899.  I demonstrate that style was always important in the
   interpretation of his work, and that this ''classic'' can be read as
   literature, scholarly discourse, humor, or poor writing-or a combination
   thereof.  A consensus on the qualities of Veblen's style has never
   emerged.  Focusing on claims emphasizing Veblen's irony, I suggest that
   an ironic interpretation is particularly likely when an author analyzes
   those with superior status.

   squares analysis of the careers of 100 PhD graduates from the class of
   1976 finds that sustained employment in a Doctor of Philosophy
   (PhD)-level department is associated with increased productivity. The
   amount of variance explained is similar to that in studies of the hard

AB Since 1988 the world has witnessed unexpectedly massive changes and
   reforms, including the destructuring of the bipolar world of the Cold
   War era, the adoption of market economies to replace centrally planned
   economies, and the democratisation of authoritarian regimes.
   Essentially, this paper argues that the turbulent transition period of
   this decade is one that may be characterised as a 'new world of new
   worlds', presenting a vast ensemble of challenges for the sociological
   analysis of modernity. A historical perspective with previous periods of
   transition from one social order to the next is proposed, as well as a
   discussion of salient general socio-psychological features of the
   contemporary situation, such as changes in collective identity. Finally,
   attention is given to a methodological approach suitable to make sense
   of our world situation.

AB This article examines alternative models of producer services
   development in metropolitan communities and analyzes factors associated
   with the development of producer services in two deindustrializing urban
   communities - the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) of
   Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Sample surveys of producer services in each
   metropolitan area reveal that establishments: (1) tend to be primarily
   dependent upon the revenue generated by local trade within the local
   metropolitan area; (2) tend to simultaneously engage in nonlocal trade
   and directly contribute to interurban integration and dominance of large
   metropolitan centers; and (3) engage most extensively in trade, both
   locally and nonlocally, with other service-sector industries, rather
   than manufacturing. These findings suggest that producer services
   development may be sustained in deindustrializing urban communities and
   that it is not primarily dependent upon trade with locally based
   manufacturing industry.

AB Data from the 1984 Carnegie survey of faculty at U.S. universities show
   substantial disciplinary variation in perceptions that one's field is
   stagnant. We examine the extent to which variation in pessimism about
   the intellectual state of one's field can be explained by theories that
   attribute it to field-level variation in anomie and consensus. We also
   examine the effects of individual-level characteristics on disciplinary
   discontent using a multilevel analysis. We find that both anomie and
   consensus exert strong effects on the average levels of scholarly
   pessimism within fields. In addition, there is an interaction effect
   involving the level of consensus in a field and whether the field is
   primarily pure or applied. The multilevel analysis shows that the
   effects of field-level variables are not attributable to compositional
   differences in individual characteristics and that, as a group, the
   field-level variables are stronger determinants of scholarly pessimism
   than individual characteristics.

AB This article addresses three issues raised in Mauk et al.s (1994)
   article on country music and suicide. First, Mauk et al.'s charge that
   suicide is an individual act that cannot be assessed through group
   statistics is a paradigmatic critique that can be leveled against the
   bulk of sociological work on suicide. The position of Mauk et al. is
   precisely that which Durkheim ([1897] 1966) polemicized against in order
   to legitimate the discipline of sociology in the nineteenth century.
   Second, their notion that ''psychological autopsies'' constitute the
   only legitimate methodology for studying suicide is an overstatement.
   Third, the noted ecological fallacy problems can, in fact, be remedied
   through properly specified models. Many ecological relationships
   involving suicide have been replicated with individual-level data.
   Fourth, the charges that our subcultural argument is ''barely implied'
   and that the notion of a country music subculture is a myth are
   inaccurate. We reiterate our subcultural theory as well as the evidence
   in support of such a subculture.

AB Sociology appears to be one of the most internally divided disciplines,
   if not the most. Departmental struggles, which have led to sociologists
   complaining to administrators about each other, have put the field in
   bad repute among campus officials and have endangered its survival in
   some schools. The American Sociological Society and American
   Sociological Association have been among the most conflict-ridden
   associations in academe for generations. Severe internecine struggles
   have a long history in the field. It may be suggested that they are
   related to the propensity of the field to attract social reformers and
   political activists. But hard evidence indicates sociology graduate
   students are among the weakest, as judged by test scores.

AB We examine the conditions that affected the progressivity of the
   individual income tax in the United States between 1916 and 1986. A
   multivariate time-series analysis shows how macroeconomic conditions,
   state imperatives, the organizational capacities of social classes, and
   political conditions have affected the progressivity and the symbolic
   component of the income tax. Progressivity is measured by the difference
   between the effective tax rates paid by moderate income and very high
   income families. The symbolic component of this tax is measured by the
   difference between the nominal tax rate and effective income tax rate
   paid by very high income families. The results reveal that changes in
   tax progressivity are due largely to macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions, such as unemployment, economic development, and budget
   deficits, although the organizational capacities of social classes and
   political conditions, such as labor organization and political
   participation, also have effects. Changes in progressivity are due
   primarily to adjustments in the rates paid by very high income families.
   However the impacts of these conditions on tax progressivity changed
   somewhat when the federal income tax was transformed into a mass tax
   during World War II. Finally, political conditions have a relatively
   greater effect on the symbolic component of the income tax than on
   progressivity. Overall, this analysis supports a structural theory of
   the state in which the influences of politics and social classes on
   revenue extraction are circumscribed by macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions.

PD APR-JUN 1994

AB We introduce the concept of defiant behavior: actions that, although
   often defined politically as crime, are defined by their actors as
   necessary, legitimate, and morally appropriate. We then link this
   concept to two distinct substantive subfields of sociology: (1)
   criminology and the sociology of deviance and social control, and (2)
   political sociology and the sociology of social movements. A review of
   the literature on organized defiance suggests a clear theoretical
   confluence between the microstructural concept of biographic
   availability, drawn from the resource mobilization and political process
   perspectives within the sociology of social movements, and social
   control theories of crime and deviance. Likewise, there is a similar
   confluence between the socialization effects of prior activism, also
   from the resource mobilization perspective, and differential
   association/social learning theory in criminology. Finally, we present
   results from a study of the defiant activities of some members of the
   sanctuary movement. The form of defiance examined here, the smuggling of
   undocumented Central Americans across the United States-Mexico border,
   provides a unique test of the scope and power of both social control and
   social learning theories.  Based on self-report survey data collected
   form a sample of 141 participants in the Tuscon, Arizona, sanctuary
   movement, our findings provide strong support for social learning theory
   but fail to support social control theory.  In fact, the observed
   effects of the control theory variables are generally in a direction
   opposite to that predicted by the theory.  Implications of the study for
   the theoretical development of criminology and deviance and for the
   sociological study of social movements are discussed.

AB Most students learn how sociologists study class in introductory
   sociology courses. This exposure also influences how students think
   about class stratification; thus it is important to know how
   Introductory textbooks portray this stratification. Sociologists
   conceptualize class in two principal ways. Distributional approaches
   depict classes as aggregates of individuals possessing some criterion
   (e.g., income). These conceptions label people descriptively, but cannot
   designate the social forces at work in class stratification, Relational
   approaches focus on relations of control and subordination which are
   established through interactions; they highlight the potential for
   conflict among classes as well as the existence of a system of
   oppression and privilege. Both approaches teach students about
   inequality, but in very different terms. A content analysis shows that
   depictions of class stratification in 15 introductory texts are
   overwhelmingly distributional This finding has implications for how
   instructors portray class stratification in contemporary societies.

   the same professor, during the fall 1992 semester In each class,
   students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. a journal-writing
   group or an attendance group. In one class, journals were collected
   three times a semester on random, unannounced dates; in the other class,
   journals were collected at the end of the semester, on the day of the
   final. Essay examinations and multiple-choice examinations were given.
   Attendance was recorded in each class. It was hypothesized that students
   who kept journals would ha ve significantly higher test scores than
   students who did not keep journals, and that students who kept journals
   in the class in which journals were routinely collected would have
   higher test scores than students who kept journals in the class in which
   journals were collected only at the end of the semester Neither
   hypothesis was supported, but number of absences and prior grade point
   average did explain variances in essay scores and multiple-choice
   scores. This finding suggests that professors may be justified in
   requiring attendance as a strategy for increased learning.

AB A theoretical framework is provided to understand a cultural group's

   aspects of phenomenology and symbolic interactionism to define
   ''landscape'' as the symbolic environment created by a human act of
   conferring meaning on nature and the environment. This landscape
   reflects the self-definitions of the people within a particular cultural
   context. Attention is directed to transformation of the physical
   environment into landscapes that reflect people's definitions of
   themselves and on how these landscapes are reconstructed in response to
   people's changing definitions of themselves. Case studies from sociology
   and anthropology illustrate the social construction of nature and the
   environment. A discussion of the applied implications of the theoretical
   framework in social impact assessment and the global implications in the

AB Secularization is most productively understood not as declining

   religious authority (1) is more consistent with recent developments in
   social theory than is a preoccupation with religion; (2) draws on and
   develops what is best in the secularization literature; and (3) reclaims
   a neglected Weberian insight concerning the sociological analysis of
   religion. Several descriptive and theoretical ''pay-offs'' of this
   conceptual innovation are discussed: new hypotheses concerning the
   relationship between religion and social movements; the enhanced
   capacity to conceptually apprehend and empirically investigate
   secularization among societies, organizations, and individuals; and
   clearer theoretical connections between secularization and other
   sociological literatures. Ironically, these connections may indeed spell
   the end of secularization theory as a distinct body of theory, but in a
   different way than previously appreciated.

AB Durkheim's doctoral dissertation can justifiably be called sociology's
   first classic. Rereading it 100 years later enables us to see major
   domains of the contemporary world where its analysis remains, of
   actuality, heuristic or yet to be fully appreciated: for example, its
   themes of anomie as economic deregulation and corporatism as an
   institutional arrangement to deal with anomie. At the same time,
   Durkheims discourse reflects its historical embeddedness, such as his
   discussion of the sexual division of labor, which needs to be reworked.
   A second feature of emergent contemporary social solidarity unforeseen
   by Durkheim (and the great majority of theorists of change) is what may
   be termed ''the return of mechanical solidarity.

AB The source of social life, according to Durkheim, is the similitude of
   consciousnesses and the division of labor. The former is best evident
   among primitive societies where a ''mechanical solidarity,'' evidenced
   by repressive law, prevails; the latter in advanced societies where
   populations evidence greater ''dynamic density,'' and juridical rules
   define the nature and relations of functions. In combating individualism
   and basing the existence of societies on a ''consensus of parts, ''
   Durkheim refutes his positivistic emphasis which denies the relevance of
   ends to a scientific study of society. In his discussion of social ends
   is a latent anti-mechanistic trend. The theory of unilinear development
   is established on deficient ethnographic data. It assumes the absence of
   division of labor among primitive societies and of any ''mechanical
   solidarity'' among modem societies. Repressive and restitutive law
   Durkheim seeks to use as indexes of mechanical and organic solidarity,
   but he does not establish with any precision the perfect associations
   which he assumes obtain between his types of solidarity and of law.

AB What was Durkheim doing-in the sense of an intended social action-in
   writing De la Division du travail social? At least a part of the answer
   is that Durkheim's project was linguistic-i.e., he was attempting to
   replace an outworn vocabulary of Cartesian metaphysics with a more
   Germanic lexicon-one in which simplicity gave way to complexity, the
   abstract to the concrete, the ideal to the real deduction to induction,
   rationalism to empiricism, and so on. To some extent, this was motivated
   by the superiority-widely acknowledged among intellectuals of the Third
   Republic-of German science and Protestant scientific education. But an
   additional motivation was Durkheim's belief that only a real, concrete
   entity-society as a ''thing'' (chose)-could provide an object worthy of
   the veneration of the ''new man'' of the Republic. Durkheim's attempt to
   construct a science of social facts was therefore itself subsidiary to
   another, ''higher'' purpose-i.e., the construction of a moral authority
   (real, concrete, complex) adequate to the needs of the Third French
   Republic. Rather than an end in itself, Durkheim's sociology should thus
   be seen as a means to other ends-i.e., the ''construction'' of a
   particular kind of ''fact''-within a specific social and historical
   context.

AB A classic text is not always canonized. Canonical texts are frequently
   anything but classics. Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society is an
   instance of the former; his Rules of Sociological Method of the latter.
   Both books are based on errors of fact and method. Division of Labor was
   so intentionally the classical theory of modern divided societies that
   Durkheim, son of generations of rabbis, totally misrepresented the facts
   of Ancient Israel. In Rules, Durkheim was so intent on writing the
   canonical text of sociology's methods that he stipulated rules that even
   he (in Suicide) could not use. Durkheim was thus a giant of the
   sociological past because, not in spite of, his errors. He erred because
   he dared to think seriously about the moral issues of his time. Hence,
   the ironic fate of Durkheim's sociology-it led in two different
   directions. From Rules and Suicide came modern empirical sociology. From
   Elementary Forms came all the antimodernists-beginning with
   Levi-Strauss, and from him, Derrida and the others-who became, among
   other things, the most articulate critics of the sociology Durkheim
   helped invent. Such is the genius of classic, if not canonical, authors
   like Durkheim.

AB Sociologists have begun to explore the gains for theory and research
   that might be achieved by artificial intelligence technology:  symbolic
   processors, expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and
   classifier systems.  The first major accomplishments of artificial
   social intelligence (ASI) have been in the realm of theory, where these
   techniques have inspired new theories as well as helping to render
   existing theories more rigorous.  Two application areas for which ASI
   holds great promise are the sociological analysis of written texts and
   data retrieval from the forthcoming Global Information Infrastructure. 
   ASI has already been applied to some kinds of statistical analysis, but
   how competitive it will be with more conventional techniques remains
   unclear.  To take advantage of the opportunities offered by ASI,
   sociologists will have to become more computer literate and will have to
   reconsider the place of programming and computer science in the
   sociological curriculum.  ASI may be a revolutionary approach with the
   potential to rescue sociology from the doldrums into which some
   observers believe it has fallen.

AB Given the imperative to develop the international awareness of our

   landscape of undergraduate education, lack of attention to the role of
   the FTA within undergraduate instruction in sociology is surprising and
   shortsighted. By allowing the FTA to remain invisible, we forgo the
   potential contribution that the FTA can make to our educational agenda,
   and we allow the quality of our students' classroom experiences to be
   compromised in ways that, as sociologists, we could easily anticipate
   and avoid. We need data on the role that FTAs play in undergraduate
   instruction in sociology in the United States. To realize the
   contribution that FTAs can make to internationalizing our curriculum, we
   need to approach the FTA problem as sociologists, involve both
   undergraduates and FTAs in the analysis of this problem, and work toward
   incorporating both groups into a sociological community of discourse.

AB Feminist Audre Lorde states, ''The master's tools will never dismantle
   the master's house.'' In this paper, however we encourage women to seize
   computer tools for their own educational purposes in order to counteract
   the ''null environment'' they experience in the traditional classroom.
   We argue for a proactive feminist pedagogy that enhances women's
   computer learning by demystifying the computer and promoting
   technological equity in the classroom. To accomplish these goals, we
   introduce a quantitative and a qualitative software program which help
   to create a proactive environment that enhances women's computerized
   learning when used in conjunction with feminist pedagogical techniques.
   We also discuss the implications of introducing feminist proactive
   computer learning into the sociology curriculum and, more specifically,
   into the women's studies classroom.

AB Computer-based testing is introduced as an alternative or supplement to

   testing, each student takes course examinations directly on a computer
   outside the classroom. We present information on how to develop and
   implement such a system, and report results of an evaluation of
   computer-based testing at one university. Practical and pedagogical
   benefits as well as problems of this testing procedure are discussed.
   Faculty members see many practical benefits of using computer-based
   testing in the introductory course, while reporting that educationally
   it is at least as sound as in-class testing. Students generally like the
   flexibility of computer-based testing and find it easy to use. The
   biggest problem is that grades tend to be lower than on in-class tests.
   Alternative uses of computer-based testing also are presented.

AB The literatures on social movements, the media, and the sociology of

   events and cultural texts. I extend this work on ''social framing '' by
   describing the construction and selection processes that explain why
   media writers appropriate some frames but not others, and why some
   frames ''resonate '' with broad cultural beliefs. I analyze the rhetoric
   in media accounts from 1985 to 1990 of the dangers posed to children and
   society by heavy metal music and rap music. I also examine the images
   used to amplify each genre of music. Although both genres have lyrical
   and performance elements focusing on sex and defiance of authority
   strong enough to evoke a moral outcry, they evoke quite different
   reactions. I argue that the racial composition of the music's audiences
   and producers shape the way the two genres are perceived.

AB Americans watch a great deal of television. But the factors
   traditionally considered to determine or explain television
   usage-availability of free time, low income or class status, low
   education, emotional difficulties, and lack of structured social
   interactions-are not generalizable across the adult life span. The
   television viewing of people over the age of 30 has been understudied-a
   research bias that mirrors society's youth orientation and essentially
   excludes older adults from this model. The author analyzed data
   collected in the National Opinion Research Center's 1988 General Social
   Survey to assess the determinants of television viewing for adults of
   all ages. Results indicate that as persons perceive themselves to be in
   different stages of life and take on age-appropriate roles, tasks, and
   perspectives, they have distinctively different reasons for viewing.
   Second, the factors considered to determine TV viewing in the
   ''traditional'' model fit the pattern of younger adults' viewing best
   while predicting the behavior of the elderly least. The author proposes
   an interpretation of the findings, and discusses future research avenues
   including the development of age-sensitive models and theories.

AB Durkheim's theory of religion is approached from the perspective of his
   lifelong concern with the question of meaning and moral order in modern
   society. This emphasis naturally leads to a consideration of wider
   themes informing Durkheim's sociology of religion than are usually found
   in analyses focusing exclusively on his treatment of primitive religion
   in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1964). Durkheim wes as the
   distinguishing feature of modernity the progressive emancipation of the
   individual from traditional sources of influence. The evolution toward
   greater individuation, culminating in the ''cult of the individual'' or
   ''religion of humanity,'' is set by Durkheim within the context of the
   role of collective ideals in promoting social change and in the
   maintenance of moral order. Religion, the major symbolic expression of
   societal wide ideals, is identified as the key variable which enables
   Durkheim to reconcile the competing demands of individuals for freedom
   with the interests of society in collective welfare.

   systematic view, of how, writing relates to the discipline of sociology.
   This article attempts to address that issue by suggesting that the
   experience of writing is fundamentally sociological. Using Mills'
   concept of the sociological imagination, I suggest that the act of
   composing any written work is a movement from the very personal and
   private to the larger social context of considering one's audience, the
   conventions of writing, and other structural (or public) issues and back
   again to the private and personal. The article concludes with
   implications for instructors who require students to write and who seek
   to help students become more effective writers.

AB One of the difficulties of integrating environmental variables into
   sociological analyses is that societies have a dualistic relationship
   with the biophysical environment. Humans are like other species in
   depending on the environment, yet humans are also unique among all
   species in the potential for altering and sometimes evading
   environmental constraints. A second and related difficulty results from
   the degree to which humans incorporate the environment into their
   everyday views of reality; the process often seems so automatic that the
   biophysical realities can be forgotten, taken for granted, or ignored,
   both by residents and by those who study them. This problem is
   particularly significant for studies that fail to be sufficiently
   comparative to be able to observe significant variations in
   environmental and technological factors. The problem is illustrated with
   a study that deals with a relatively traditional social-psychological
   dependent variable-attitudes toward a proposed development. The focus is
   on the apparent paradox of a form of industrial development that has
   been welcomed with open arms in one area of the country while virtually
   opening armed warfare in another, namely drilling for offshore oil. To
   explain the marked differences across regions, it is necessary to
   understand the influence of biophysical and technological variables, as
   well as the social and historical differences across the regions.
   Implications for further research are discussed.

AB Perspectives in sociology are currently being.reassessed in light of
   postmodernism, which has been associated with the abandonment of faith
   in the social self and scientific inquiry. As an emergent problematic,
   postmodernism stands in sharp contrast to a modernist pragmatic (and
   innocent) conception of symbolic interactionism-which is centered in the
   Meadian conception of prosocial selves. However, this article identifies
   some ''late-modem'' interactionists-Goffman, Stone, Becker, Lemert, and
   Mills-who, in providing a corrective for an innocent pragmatic inquiry
   into the self, created a foundation for contemporary inquiry into the
   social. This corrective entailed a reconceptualization of the self as
   the focal point of the situated act and, specifically, its changing
   definition from cooperative and reflective to strategic and imaginary.
   While we suggest that their work represented a loss of innocence in
   interactionism, it did not create a loss of faith in scientific inquiry
   into the self and social action. Rather, the work of the late modernists
   has inspired a reconstruction of scientific inquiry into the social that
   encompasses, but is not encompassed by, postmodernism.

AB Max Weber's concept of formal rationality and ideas about lifestyles in
   general are applied to current trends in health lifestyles. The central
   contribution of Weber's thinking is recognition of the dialectical
   interplay between formal versus substantive rationality, consumption
   versus production, choice versus life chances, class similarities versus
   distinctions, and self-control versus conformity in shaping health
   lifestyles and the reality of their operationalization in the postmodern
   world. In a largely applied subdiscipline like medical sociology,
   Weber's work offers a theoretical background on which to enrich our
   understanding of health lifestyles and grapple with the initial
   theoretical challenges posed by lifestyle research.

AB Sociological discourse has generally represented Satanism as a harmless,
   law-abiding alternative religion. Conversely, the antisocial and
   criminal aspects of Satanism have been the focus of most lay writing and
   media exposure. Such academic and popular portrayals are reflecting
   different facets of Satanism's heterogeneous nature. Through reexamining
   the literature, this article provides a conceptual framework for
   analyzing the differences between sociological and lay depictions. The
   term ''Satanic Establishment'' is used to refer to the respectable forms
   of Satanism, whereas the ''Satanic Underground'' denotes the
   reputed-criminal elements of Satanism. With the Satanic Establishment
   and Underground at opposite positions, a Satanic continuum of social
   acceptability is proposed.

AB In this paper I describe a minicourse, adapted to an illiberal
   pedagogical setting, that draws on the Vietnam War, and I provide a
   synopsis of its content. My purpose is to suggest a strategy for using
   the war as a case study for two topics central to the concerns of
   sociologists-inequality and ideology. Data about the war are marshaled
   to address two questions: ''Were the burdens of war equally
   distributed?'' and ''Was the American military handicapped in Vietnam by
   political constraints?'' To address the first question, I use
   information about the draft, draft policy, and American casualties to
   suggest that policy reproduced institutionalized inequalities of race
   and class. To the second question I bring to bear measures of American
   operations-expenditures and destructive force-and total casualties to
   argue that conservative apologies invoking self-defeating limits ignore
   the magnitude and consequences of our efforts in Vietnam. Within the
   synopsis, I incorporate sources for data, note some problems in the data
   available, make suggestions about interpretation, and address some
   pedagogical issues.

AB This paper constructs a set of criteria for identifying the paradigmatic
   underpinnings of racial and ethnic relations textbooks. It applies those
   criteria to 10 recent books and summarizes the findings. With few
   exceptions, the textbooks favor assimilationist, cultural pluralist, or
   eclectic approaches. The compilation of social histories is emphasized
   over theory review and evaluation. The debate on the declining
   significance of race receives little attention. Comparative analysis
   reveals a number of problems in these books; for example, eclectic
   approaches are constructed from a set of contradictory assumptions. The
   paper argues that these problems are rooted in the troubled relationship
   between American liberalism and the sociology of racial and ethnic
   relations. It concludes by briefly suggesting how these problems can be
   overcome.

AB In current science studies, there are only few systematic efforts at
   explaining how different scientific specialties change over time. Such
   specialties are viewed here as organizations in which workers deal with
   various degrees of task uncertainty and mutual dependence. The
   sociological theory of change suggests that scientific change is
   generally triggered by competition, but that various types of change
   depend on the social organization and status of scientific groups. Some
   fields change through permanent discoveries, some through specialization
   and cumulation, yet others change through cognitive fragmentation. This
   argument can synthesize the various independent branches of contemporary
   science studies. The proposed theory has wider significance for some
   core problems in sociology, such as the relationship between the natural
   and social sciences, the prospects for a science of society, and the
   possibility of cumulative progress.

AB During a career that has spanned more than 40 years, Roy Francis has
   made substantial contributions to sociological teaching and research.
   Building on his experiences as a student, he holds dear the ideals of a
   liberal education and continues to search for new ways of transmitting
   those ideals in the face of changing social patterns. A prolific writer,
   Francis' books and papers often examine the proper relations between
   theory and research and explore the potential of symbolic interactionism
   as an epistemological framework. He has been active in sociology's
   professional affairs, especially in promoting visual sociology as a
   teaching and learning medium. His roles as a student, professor,
   administrator, and president of the Midwest Sociological Society round
   out a career that has encompassed all facets of modem scholarship. In
   each of these roles, Francis stresses the moral dimensions of the
   academic life, and he instills in his students the sense of intellectual
   obligation to their scholarly forebears that he feels toward his own.

   musical selections frequently associated with sport with a focus on the
   meaning these musical selections have to the listeners. Other studies of
   music and society indicate that music may provide a means of promoting a
   collective consciousness, social integration, and political ideology.
   The present study utilizes an auditory elicitation approach. That is,
   respondents wrote the subjective meanings they associated with the
   musical selections as they were being played. The selections elicited a
   variety of meanings and emotions from the respondents. The responses to
   the music are interpreted within the functionalist, critical, and
   sociology of emotions/nostalgia frameworks.

   Goffman's ''Communication Conduct in an Island Community'' (1953) with
   respect to several key Durkheimian concepts. Also discussed are several

   Stanford Lyman-which help to further delineate the conditions of the

AB One of the central goals of teaching sociology is the development in
   students of sociological perspective, which encourages them to reflect
   on their own society from a distance. The concept of ethnocentrism is
   often introduced in sociology courses to sensitize students to the ways
   in which their perceptions of social life are shaped by the fact that
   they are ''insiders'' to their own society and ''outsiders'' to others.
   Here we discuss a series of instructional techniques built around the
   use of Horace Miner's classic, ''Body Ritual among the Nacirema,'' which
   we have developed and implemented to assist students in developing an
   awareness of social influences on their perceptions and judgments. The
   techniques are based on the observation that ethnocentrism involves two
   forms of distortion, termed ''insider's bias'' and ''outsider's bias.''
   Students must confront both of these in order to develop a full
   appreciation of the subtle impact of culture on perceptions.

AB Refugees are individuals forced to flee from their homelands because of
   categorical persecution or because they are bystanders caught in the
   crossfire of war or civil strife. Such involuntary exile often leads to
   alienation in the most literal sense of the term. Whether expellees,
   escapees, or displaced persons, refugees share a common fate and, often,
   a common destiny: those who are dispossessed are dependent on others to
   provide care, succor, protection, and assistance. Yet responses to their
   plight are almost invariably highly selective, the quality of mercy
   being strained by considerations other than pure altruism. This paper, a
   commentary on the sociology of exile, attempts to convey the sense and
   significance of estrangement and responses to it in both historical and
   contemporary contexts. Early sections deal with concepts and concerns;
   later ones examine United States refugee policies and practices relating
   to exile, ethnicity, and the politics of rescue.

AB Feminist phase theory describes the process of integrating women's
   studies scholarship as a series of identifiable stages, for both
   individuals and disciplines. Literature on the revolutionary and
   paradigm-shift potential of women's studies scholarship suggests
   important disciplinary differences in its construction, adoption, and
   diffusion. We reformulate feminist phase theory in paradigm shift terms,
   then operationalize and contrast two versions of it. Our analysis and
   review indicate that the missing variable in women's studies
   transformation projects is the participants' discipline. Data from our
   integration project show faculty in interpretive disciplines scoring
   higher on degree of integration of women's studies scholarship but not
   changing as a result of the project itself, while those in positivist
   disciplines do change but have lower absolute scores. These findings
   indicate a need for different integration strategies based on
   discipline. Empirical support for one sequential ordering in feminist
   phase theory argues for the importance and centrality of women-focused
   scholarship.

AB A selective appropriation of postmodernist theories is undertaken with
   special reference to their applicability to macrosociology and to other
   branches of sociological inquiry that employ conceptions of social and
   cultural totality. The appropriation is premised on the thesis that
   theories of culture, such as postmodernism, can contribute to sociology
   by their analyses of cultural form, providing sociology with general
   descriptions of what social processes must mediate and with guidance on
   how to grasp its own cultural form(s). Three notions of cultural
   totality, ''bricolage'' (Claude Levi-Strauss), ''discursive formation''
   (Michel Foucault), and ''deconstruction'' (Jacques Derrida), are
   considered. All have in common a description of cultural form that
   stresses nonsystematic order. They are contrasted to Talcott Parsons'
   modernist and systematizing macrotheoretic reflection on culture and
   society. A deconstruction of Parsons yields the alternative of a
   less-than-systematic, postmodernized (macro)-sociology.

   individualistic explanations for poverty, and critiqued the role of
   academics in the victim blaming process. At the current time, as
   economic inequality increases and homelessness becomes a problem of
   growing public concern, the potential for sociology to facilitate victim
   blaming is of interest and concern. Some of the motivations and

   the extent to which his background influenced the themes and
   orientations of his sociological work.
   The paper may be read as a contribution to the sociology of knowledge
   from the autobiographical point of view. It stresses the various stages
   of the author's career and attempts to show the extent to which these

   superseded by a fertile political economy paradigm that continues to
   orchestrate current research. The contributions of political economy are
   reviewed under six headings: historical explanation, comparative
   studies, socioeconomic processes, spatial relations, ethnicity and
   community, and political movements. The conclusion argues that urban
   sociology is currently in need of new directions. Some criticisms and

AB Macrocomparative research has a broad reach within the discipline. We
   review recent books and articles engaging in comparison, either of
   nations or of structures and processes within two or more nations. We
   focus on how macrocomparative sociologists address the threats to
   validity which surround sample selection, research design, and data and
   measurement. Nearly all the studies we investigate have explanation as a
   goal. A major threat to many studies (almost a third) is the failure to
   apply any method of control. Most authors wish to draw general
   conclusions, but problems of sampling raise questions about their
   ability to do so. Researchers agree that measurement is problematic.
   However, issues surrounding measurement are largely neglected. We
   describe these and more specific empirical findings regarding the
   practice of macrocomparative research.

AB Research on life transitions highlights the normative and nonnormative
   changes that individuals experience over time. During the past two
   decades, life course perspectives have provided a strategic context for
   studying the genesis of life transitions and their personal and social
   consequences. Both population-based and individual models of transitions
   have become more complex, focusing on the ways that social and
   historical contexts shape life transitions. At the individual level,
   progress has also been made in identifying the mechanisms by which
   transitions affect outcomes. Research on life transitions continues to
   grapple with two major issues-the challenges raised by heterogeneity,
   and the need to better link macro and micro perspectives-although
   advances have been made in both cases. One of the most promising
   characteristics of recent studies is cross-fertilization of concepts and
   methods from previously distinct research traditions: role theory,
   social stress theory, and life course sociology.

AB Sociologists are paying increasing professional attention to food,

   incorparating the subject into the classroom is a useful means of
   helping students understand sociology. The sociology of food and
   nutrition can be taught in several settings, including in sociology
   departments as an entire course, in lectures in other courses, or in
   continuing and occasional examples. Sociologists also teach in nutrition
   and food science departments and other applied settings. Three
   approaches to teaching in this area are described: 1) sociology of food
   and nutrition. 2) food and society, and 3) nutritional sociology.
   Practical instructional issues in teaching the sociology of food and
   nutrition include combining the fields of sociology and nutrition, the
   diversity of students, experiential learning, and team teaching.
   Teaching resources include reading materials, audiovisuals, syllabi,
   organizations, and publications. Incorporating food, eating, and
   nutrition topics into the classroom can make a significant contribution
   to sociological teaching.

   links theories to a common concern or explanatory logic. This paper
   provides a specific example of one integrating theme that can be used in
   courses in complex organization and organization theory. I show how the
   unique capacities and nature of the human (or labor) factor of
   production-as a conscious, reflective, and reactive organizational
   input-have posed difficulties and dilemmas for both organization
   theories and managerial strategies of control. This theme is applied to
   a series of different theoretical topics, issues, and problems typically

   the improvement of students' writing skills while neglecting the power
   of writing as a teaching and learning tool in a student-centered
   (collaborative) classroom. Social and cognitive rationales for
   purposeful writing-for-learning assignments are provided, not only to
   enhance communication skills but also to change students' knowledge
   structures through written dialogue and metacognitive questioning. We

AB This paper explores the possibility of developing a general and formal
   social-action theory of labeling emotions. The theory is based upon the
   assumption that there is an underlying formal structural social-action
   system of expectations and sanctions that significantly influence how
   actors label their emotions. Some permutations of the four basic
   expectation-sanction states are elaborated, hypothetically labeled, and
   tested over a 14-year period.  The ''constructionist'' view of the
   necessity of a cultural context in labeling emotions is challenged by
   removing the ''moral'' content from the survey instrument. The findings
   indicate that the formal model, devoid of content, is effective in
   differentiating emotion labels. The tests yielded promising results for
   developing a comprehensive and formal mapping of emotions. Taxonomical
   extrapolations of the theory are suggested and some further applications
   and needed research are discussed.

   the economic actions undertaken by large firms, while the differences in
   manager or owner or bank control and the presence of bank interlocks do
   not. A sociology of markets is therefore more likely to account for the
   courses of actions of large firms by considering these relations, rather
   than focusing on the construction of interests by bankers, owners, or

AB Raw material extraction once offered an effective route to economic
   development, but societal relationships with environment and technology
   have changed so fundamentally that extractive industries today appear
   more likely to lead rural regions to economic addiction. Key
   characteristics of addictive activities include rising costs of
   operation at most extractive facilities, combined with downward trends
   in world commodity prices. Key characteristics of vulnerable communities
   and regions include increasing geographic isolation, imbalances of scale
   and power with respect to extractive industries, and the absence of
   realistic alternatives for diversified development. Key pressures toward
   addiction are created by ambiguities that mask the addictive tendencies,
   including ambiguities of price signals, of employment and development
   possibilities for remote regions, and of resource exhaustion. The net
   result is that, while the encouragement to develop extractive industries
   is often coupled with advice to avoid developing an excessive dependency
   on a single economic sector, the very regions and nations having the
   greatest need to hear such advice may also have the lowest realistic
   ability to respond to it.

   observations about the linkages of sociology to its specialties by
   reviewing the changing relationship of sociology and criminology. In the
   United States, the development of criminology as a field of study has
   been closely linked to the development of sociology as a discipline, and
   sociology has given American criminology its distinctive cast.
   Criminology has benefited from theoretical and methodological
   developments in sociology and in tum has contributed to sociology as one
   of its central specialties. In the past two decades, the dominance of
   sociology in criminology has diminished, and criminology has gravitated
   somewhat away from the cen ter of sociology. However, sociology remains
   very much the intellectual 'center of gravity" in criminology, and
   criminology remains an important part of sociology. Both criminology and
   sociology will benefit by a continuation and reinvigoration of their
   prior relationship.

AB This article uses a sociology of knowledge approach to discuss the
   reproduction of inequality within the sociocultural world of clerical
   workers. A model of a semiotic square is used to analyze the experiences
   of bored and busy work. Through this analysis of bored and busy work,
   the author discovered clerical workers' perceptions and activities which
   were both subordinating and empowering. Clerical workers participate in
   the process of subordination through bored/busy work. However, they also
   participate in empowering strategies through not-bored/not-busy work.
   This sociology of knowledge approach shows that people are not
   automatons and strengthens our understanding of the social reproduction
   of inequality as a multi-faceted phenomenon.

AB Drawing on a 3-year ethnography and participant observation study of a
   ghetto gym in Chicago, this article purports to (a) de-exoticize the
   subproletarian bodily craft of boxing by uncovering its embedded social
   logic and meaning, and (b) contribute to a theory of practice that
   escapes the false antinomies associated with rational choice and
   normative models of action. The first part explores the peculiar
   relation of symbiotic opposition that ties the boxing gym to its
   proximate social matrix of the black ghetto and to the masculine street
   culture from which it draws its sustenance and shelters its members. The
   second part treats boxing as a Durkheimian "social art" whose mastery
   involves an intensive, ascetic, and strictly regulated manipulation of
   the body designed to inculcate through direct embodiment the set of
   corporeal, visual, and mental schemata immanent to pugilistic practice.
   The social production of the pugilistic habitus as embodied practical
   reason thus suggests the need to place the socialized lived body at the
   center of the analysis of social action.

AB Previous research contends that when Talcott Parsons developed the
   substantive argument of The Structure of Social Action, he turned away
   from the theoretical emptiness of American social science and drew on
   the ideas of four European social thinkers- Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and
   Marshall. Such research exemplifies the "content-fit model" of
   predecessor selection, which assumes that intellectual predecessors are
   chosen on the basis of a fit between their ideas and the project of the
   thinker who engages them. This model fails to explain Parsons's
   exclusion of the American institutionalists, most notably his Amherst
   teachers Walton Hamilton and Clarence Ayres, whose work fit directly
   with the argument of The Structure of Social Action. Institutionalist
   work was also characterized, however, by its negative reputation,
   particularly at, Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where
   Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber were thinkers of growing
   reputational standing. Examination of Parsons's involvement in the local
   Harvard network indicates that contemporary reputational judgments
   decisively affected his choice of intellectual predecessors. This
   analysis also brings to light the organizational and institutional
   conditions under which a "reputational model" is required to understand
   the process of predecessor selection.

AB Over the past few years, numerous studies in sociology have concluded
   that foreign investment harms poor nations. These studies have focused
   on the coefficient for foreign capital stock, controlling for "flow"
   (new investment), and-defying logic-have inferred that a negative
   coefficient for stock reflects "dependency effects" that retard economic
   growth. Since capital stock is the denominator for investment rate, the
   greater the stock, the lower the investment rate, for a given level of
   new investment. Hence the negative coefficient for capital stock found
   in dependency studies indicates a beneficial investment effect, not a
   harmful effect. This point is demonstrated by reanalysis of the data
   used in dependency studies. In these data, foreign investment spurs
   growth. Earlier analysts have concluded otherwise only because their
   conclusions have belied their findings.

   need to carefully screen and prepare students, to acquaint them with the
   variety of placements available, and to take into account any special
   needs they may have. Site visits and seminars are also discussed as a
   means of ensuring quality supervision and sensitizing students to
   potential problems they may encounter in the placement site. The article
   stresses the importance of carefully crafted and legally sound contracts
   and emphasizes the need to consult risk management specialists to ensure
   appropriate and complete insurance coverage.

   tend to provide an ethnocentric portrayal of education by placing the
   United States and other northern industrialized nations at the center of
   the educational universe while virtually ignoring educational issues in
   relation to the three-quarters of the world's population, those who live

AB The use of internships in educating sociology majors has increased in
   recent years so that currently most departments offer some type of
   internship opportunity. Most programs are on a small scale, offering
   three or four hours of course credit. Although a major justification of
   internship programs is that they help students in career choice
   clarification, there has been little hard evidence that small-scale
   programs achieve this end. Using qualitative and quantitative data to
   evaluate a small-scale internship program, this research found that it
   helped students significantly in clarifying career choices, by providing
   information on occupations, reducing indecisiveness and anxiety
   regarding choice, and increasing confidence in the ability to choose.

   addressed an extraordinarily broad array of social phenomena, often of a
   community problem variety, in his research. His research employed a
   social systems analysis frequently focused on the rural context and had
   a strong applied orientation with the result that his findings have been
   widely used as the basis for the formulation of important national and
   international program and policy decisions. Bertrand's work has
   attracted wide attention abroad as well as in the United States. Because
   of his many contributions to the discipline of sociology, he has
   received numerous awards and recognitions and has also been elected to
   various offices in professional societies and associations, including

AB Historical sociologists have criticized their discipline for a tendency
   to ignore the temporal dimensions of social life, either by studying the
   correlates of outcomes rather than the character of temporally connected
   events or by treating events as surface manifestations of large-scale
   and long-term processes of change. These critiques have led to a
   reassessment of the value of narratives and to new methods for mapping
   historical sequences of events. Yet there has been relatively little
   discussion of the concepts needed to create a more event-centered
   historical sociology. This article explores the way in which four
   different concepts of time - duration, pace, trajectory, and cycle -
   have been used in recent historical social science. These concepts allow
   one to analyze the temporal characteristics of connected events that
   constitute long-term historical processes as well as the way in which
   actors understand and experience the temporal flow of events. They are
   most useful, the author argues when employed in a manner that is
   attentive to the understandings of social actors and the problematic
   reconstruction of the past. These concepts constitute building blocks
   for the construction of a more event-centered historical sociology.

AB With the re-emergence of historical sociology as a dominant focus of
   inquiry has come a renewed interest in more general methodological,
   theoretical, and epistemological issues that have long occupied debates
   about the relationship between history and theory. A recently published
   article by Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter brings to the fore several
   core themes in these debates. Kiser and Hechter claim that comparative
   historical sociologists not only have turned against general theory but
   theories in general. The authors argue that these conclusions are based
   on a narrow definition of the enterprise of historical sociology and on
   an attempt to confine the definition of theory to general laws. In this
   article, they first demonstrate that historical sociologists have not
   forsaken theory. Next, they articulate the dilemmas that general
   theories defined as general laws pose for historical analysis, and
   finally, they delineate what methodologically self-conscious historical
   sociologists have identified as the core elements of a temporally
   grounded historical sociology.

AB We examine the structure of sociology using data on overlapping
   memberships in the discipline's "visible colleges," the specialty
   sections of the American Sociological Association. Hypotheses about the
   structure of joint specialization in sociology are derived from four
   general theories of professional and scientific specialization: 
   ideational theory, political-economic theory, professional power theory,
   and intellectual circle/network theory.  We analyze joint specialty
   section memberships using multidimensional scaling techniques and
   produce a spatial model of the discipline's specialty structure.  The
   tightest clusters of specialties arise from the confluence of ideational
   aspects (like shared concepts or subject matter), professional power
   interests, and social characteristics of members.  Although a major
   division in the discipline is embedded in the political-economic
   environment of sociology, three cross-cutting dimensions are required to
   adequately  represent the discipline's structure. The main dimensions of
   differentiation are:  (1) "conflict" versus "applied" perspectives, (2)
   micro versus macro units of analysis, and (3) ascriptive characteristics
   of members. These three dimensions support the validity of
   political-economic, ideational, and professional power theories,
   respectively.

AB Chances of realizing a legal rationality that does not fit society are
   limited. Referring to Weber's "Sociology of Law," to related themes in
   the sociology of polity, organizations, and occupations, and to recent
   debates on technocratization, juridification, delegalization, and
   responsive law, this article presents a theoretical discussion of this
   thesis. An empirical case, using the neoclassical concept of sentencing
   guidelines, exemplified by the federal and Minnesota cases, supports the
   argument. The neoclassical movement, aiming to reverse the
   substantivation of law and to correct lack of due process, functional
   failures, disparities, and discrimination, faces considerable
   impediments and may result in counterproductive effects. The article
   demonstrates that (1) societal conditions that caused substantivation
   hamper reformalization in the political process; organizational and

AB Today sociologists tend to doubt the rural-urban continuum, the idea
   that community is more characteristic of country places than cities.
   Based on an ethnographic study of an English exurban village, I argue
   that the continuum remains an important source of identity for country
   residents, one from which they derive social-psychological and material
   benefits. They root this conception of themselves as country people in
   nature, making this identity a particularly secure one. These real
   social consequences suggest that sociology should no longer doubt the
   reality of the rural-urban continuum, at least at the level of the
   definition of the situation. It, therefore, should remain an important
   topic of sociological study.

AB This paper outlines four theoretical approaches to the sociology of
   weapons proliferation:  strategic-functional theories, factional
   theories, geopolitical theories, and institutional theories.  Although
   rarely formulated explicitly, the first three approaches are implicit in
   the existing literature on proliferation.  All three see proliferation
   as the result of rational decision making, although they differ as to
   the locus of these decisions, with strategic-functional theories
   focusing on the nation-state, factional theories on subnational
   interests, and geopolitical theories on global superpowers.  In
   contrast, the institutional approach disputes the rationality of
   procurement, arguing instead that weapons purchases are structured and
   driven by institutionalized normative structures that link advanced
   weaponry with modernization and soverignty.  The policy implications of
   this perspective are discussed, and parallels to recent developments in
   organizational theory are highlighted.

   sociology: total segregation, as in all-male faculties; appointments of
   women in token or solo positions; variations in the departmental faculty
   sex ratio; and the "ghettoization" of women in lower academic ranks and
   positions with heavy committee assignments. These outcomes are analyzed
   at the organizational level as the product of the operation of internal
   and external labor markets in academia. Drawing on a representative 1984
   national survey of sociology departments (N = 230), multivariate
   analyses indicate that a large proportion of the variation in gender
   integration from one department to the next can be predicted from the
   organizational context. Several organizational factors appear to
   militate against total segregation (all-male faculties) while promoting
   balance in the faculty sex ratio and in the distribution of academic
   rank. These include demand for labor in the form of job opportunities,
   especially those created through turnover; women in the institutional
   power structure, including a separate women's studies program; and a
   state legislative climate favoring women's legal and political rights.

AB Blau's (1977) macrostructural theory builds on the assumption that
   social structure affects intergroup relations.  This relationship
   depends upon the opportunity for intergroup contact.  Previous tests of
   Blau's theory, however, treat opportunity as an unmeasured construct. 
   P*, as a measure of opportunity for intergroup contact, not only enables
   a test of that assumption, but also merges general sociological
   principles with specific middle-range ones like those urban sociology
   develops.
   Findings here modestly support Blau's opportunity for contact
   assumption.  Serendipitously, the analysis demonstrates that
   heterogeneity asymmetrically influences opportunities for intergroup
   contact between groups of varying size.  Because increasing
   heterogeneity presupposes an increase in the minority proportion and a
   decrease in the majority, it enhances majority and suppresses minority
   opportunities for intergroup contact.  This suggests that Blau's
   heterogeneity theorem, which assumes a symmetrical effect on contact,
   needs some qualification.

AB It is relatively easy to determine if evidence supports or does not
   support a given theory or conclusion, but a central problem in sociology
   is our inability to go beyond this and develop truly convincing evidence
   about a theory.  Several changes in current practices are vital,
   including the cessation of nonproductive assaults between sociologists
   on the evidence used in the discipline.  More fundamentally, theory
   should not be viewed as one pole of a continuum with research on the
   other end.  A probabilistic view of theory is proposed such that a
   theory may be correct even if there is negative evidence.  This leads to
   a different way of evaluating evidence, a different view of the role of
   examples, a distinction between explanations of particular events as
   opposed to evaluations of theories, skepticism about the possibility of
   developing theories that account for long complex chains of events, and
   a sharp differentiation between the evidence used in applied as opposed
   to basic research.  A new sociological specialty should concern itself
   with epistemological issues that arise in determining the verifiable
   propositions that are the basic building blocks to sociological
   knowledge.

AB In this article, data on home health agencies reveal surprisingly few
   differences between organizations of different tax status (nonprofit vs.
   forprofit). These findings directly contradict economic theories of
   nonprofit organization, as well as third-party government theory from
   political science. Since ecological theory in sociology proposes a
   useful explanation for organizational similarities, the authors search
   for differences between nonprofit and forprofit organizations among
   generalists and specialists. They find that specialists are quite
   similar, regardless of tax status, but generalists are different, a
   disparity that seems to contradict ecological analysis. Since
   institutional theory also explains isomorphism, the authors search for
   differences between organizations that do and do not belong to chains.
   Chains are more similar than nonchains. The discussion of the results
   centers on changes in the institutional context of home health care over
   the last decade, especially cascade effects of prospective payment
   schemes and the advent of new organizational forms. The authors conclude
   that the idea of accommodative isomorphism helps account for
   similarities among nonprofit and for-profit chains.

   faculty members at a midwestern university introduced critical thinking
   into their introductory sociology courses as a specific instructional

   programs and the specific strategies these faculty members used in
   nurturing critical reasoning skills.  We developed a four-page
   questionnaire to assess the students' perceptions of these programs. 
   Overall the programs appear effective in the eyes of the students; 70
   percent believed they had adequate opportunities to develop their
   critical reasoning skills, and 62 percent reported an increase in those
   skills.  We discuss the findings from this project in terms of the
   relevance of critical thinking to the sociology curriculum.

AB As a result of environmental and agrarian activism and of academic
   critique, a substantial amount of space is available now for moving
   agricultural technoscience onto new trajectories. A critical rural
   sociology has played a key role in pushing forward the deconstructive
   project that has been instrumental in creating this space. And rural
   sociologists can be active agents in the reconstruction of the
   alternative science that must emerge from "actually existing" science
   and that must be developed if there is to be a truly alternative
   agriculture. But to be effective in this effort we need to enlarge not
   only the canon of our colleagues in the natural sciences, but our own
   canon as well. This article suggests that the theoretical resources for
   such reconstruction are available in contemporary sociological and
   feminist interpretations of science. Material resources for the
   reconstruction of a "successor science" are to be found in the "local
   knowledge" that is continually produced and reproduced by farmers and
   agricultural workers. Articulations and complementarities between
   theoretical resources are suggested and potentially productive research
   areas are outlined.

AB American norms for the proper timing of events are reflected in a
   preference for academic achievement "on schedule." Unlike most other
   societies with formalized education, however, we also tolerate
   educational late blooming. The preference for blooming "on time" may be
   explained by the positive social functions of scheduling educational
   success. Such rigidity in the American experience, however, would run
   counter to the value we place on higher education as a medium for
   equality of opportunity and would threaten the existence of many
   institutions of higher learning that serve specialized markets. While
   the American tolerance for educational late blooming has created
   opportunities not found in other societies, late blooming may also have
   the latent dysfunction of encouraging "temporal loafing. "

   adjudicative posture and evaluate the conflicting claims of rival
   schools.  This suggestion is elaborated in the context of Ritzer's
   pioneering work on metatheorizing.

PY 1991
AB The current debates on metatheory in sociology do not account for the
   fact that metatheorizing, as a distinct intellectual activity, is
   unequally distributed throughout the sciences.  As a reflexive and
   critical subspecialty, metatheory and metasociology are more likely to
   routinely accompany work in loosely coupled and highly controversial
   disciplines.  The theory of scientific organizations explains the
   propensity for metatheorizing as the outcome of weak and conversational
   fields that rely mostly on texts to support their discourse.

EP 357
PD FAL 1991
PY 1991
AB When Parsons derived action theory from Durkheim's sociology, he also
   argued with Durkheim, disputed his claims, and expressly rejected some
   of his fundamental principles.  Accordingly, American functionalism
   contained a hidden "negative image" of Durkheim.  Parsons's student,
   Harold Garfinkel, addressed functionalism at its weak points, eventually
   overthrowing most of what Parsons had to say about society.  Some of
   these weak points were predicated on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim,
   including explicit rejection of Durkheim's equivalences between society,
   morality, and objective reality.  Garfinkel's ethnomethodology therefore
   rejected what had been premised on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim.  In
   so doing, it reversed the negative image of Durkheim back to its
   positive classical form and empirically demonstrated some of Durkheim's
   most troubling principles.  Since Garfinkel did not deliberately recover
   Durkheim in this manner, the dynamics of this case make it an
   interesting study of how theorists read other theorists.

AB This paper examines recent developments in meta-study in sociology which
   involves metatheory, metamethod, and meta-data-analysis.  It argues that
   the three branches of meta-study, though previously unrelated, are now
   rapidly converging, signaling, among other things, the existence of a
   sustained crisis in the discipline.  It concludes that meta-study will
   continue to grow in sociology for some time to come.

VL 34

EP 235
PD SUM 1991
PY 1991
AB Karl Polanyi remains one of the most trenchant critics of neoclassical
   economics. His "embeddedness" thesis, which holds that all economic
   activities and institutions are enmeshed in social relations and
   institutions, offers a sound theoretical basis for economic sociology.
   Nonetheless, he fails to embed the market concept. This theoretical
   lacuna manifests itself in his classic account of the rise of market
   society in England, The Great Transformation ([1944] 1957), where he
   neglects to consider institutional diversity and discontinuities in
   English commercial development. Polanyi's embeddedness thesis can be
   taken to its logical conclusion; that is, even the market can be
   embedded. "Markets" can be treated as social networks or organizations
   constituted by traders. I offer as an empirical illustration a brief
   case study of the rise of "market society" in England.
